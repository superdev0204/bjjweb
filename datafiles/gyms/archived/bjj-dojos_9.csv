In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 13. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof program is for you!";"https://www.graciejiujitsubillings.com/socialsite/women-empowered";"Women Empowered is the official Gracie self-defense program for women. In this 10-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 15 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to Pink Belt! If you have no previous martial arts experience and you want to learn how to defend yourself in a fun, safe, and cooperative learning environment, Women Empowered is for you.

At that time there were only three blue belts in the Carolinas. In 1997, Brent Pierce started training with Greg in Jiu-jitsu as he was running a successful school called California Combat Concepts (CCC). Brent had been putting on boxing and kickboxing events. Some of the first MMA events ever held on the east coast were by Brent over the Virginia line because it was illegal in North Carolina at that time. Greg’s students were in the first MMA events and dominated. In 1998, Greg changed the name of his school to the Academy of Mixed Martial Arts (AMMA) where he offered Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. Brent started having Greg do monthly seminars at his school and Greg became their Grappling coach. In 1999, they decided to start fighting under the same name, Team R.O.C.( Realty of Combat). This was a name they were using to train law enforcement and military together as a team. In 2004 Royce Gracie invited over 100 of his top student to Team R.O.C. and gave out his first Black Belts, to Greg and four other students. Over the past several years Team R.O.C. students have opened up schools all over the east coast. Some of Greg’s students that started with him in the 1990’s as white and blue belts are now Black Belts and have their own TEAM ROC® School: Spencer Canup, Jason Culbreth, Billy Dowey, Jason Palacios, Brian Mingie, Brandon Garner, Mazi Heydary. Team R.O.C. has been featured in MMA Worldwide Magazine. TEAM ROC® fighters have appeared in some of the top shows in the world including: K1, UFC, IFL, StrikeForce, King of the Cage, Bodog Fights, and HDNET Fights. Some Pro-Fighters from Team R.O.C.

This isn’t hyperbole either; our gym has sent two fighters to compete on the reality television show The Ultimate Fighter, including former UFC fighter Pablo Garza. Spicer, who himself claims an undefeated 8-0 record in competitive mixed martial arts, is committed to empowering every student at the Academy of Combat Arts to achieve their personal goals. As someone who once drove over five hours from Grand Forks, ND to Brooklyn Park, Minn. to attend the Academy, training under acclaimed mixed martial artist Greg Nelson, he understands the drive and commitment it takes to attain excellence. His fellow instructors similarly share this spirit of determination, and seek to pass it on to their students at the ACA. Our facility features a full ring and cage, in addition to an ample amount of floor mat space for our students to train at their best. We offer our classes six days a week, with available times to suit diverse schedules. Men and women of all ages are welcome to pursue their martial arts goals with us, whether their interest is in recreation, exercise, or training for competition.

His family has had a long tradition of fighters including his great grandfather Mickey Finn, the legendary bare knuckle champion of Ireland. Mick began Martial Arts training at the age of 7. From 1980 to 1985 Mick went undefeated and become the Irish Kickboxing Champion. For three of those years Mick was forced to fight in the adult divisions, even though he had not met his majority. His tournament and fight schedule allowed him to travel much of Northern Europe. On December 6th, 1986 at the age of 18 Mick made the decision to immigrate to the United States. He attended Bellevue University full time until 1988 when a position opened up at Saint Joseph Center for Mental Health where he became the Fitness coordinator for the hospital, it’s patients and staff. He also opened his first Martial Arts school in the same year called The Midwest fighting Arts Academy. In 1989 he met one of his childhood goals—being recognized as one the best active fighters in the world. He was ranked the number one welterweight fighter in the IKKC World rankings by Denver based World promoter Vern Stephenson, and later that year one his first World Title in Muay Thai. In September 1994, Mick won his second World title. The IKBO (International Kickboxing Organization ) based out of Emmen, Holland and run by Mr. Fred Royers. On April 25th, 1996 Mick was appointed Head Coach of the United States Muay Thai Team. In May of that year Mick traveled with the team to Thailand to train and compete in the Princes Cup World Championship. After returning from Thailand, Mick began to spend more time perfecting his Jui Jitsu and Grappling skills. Mick was introduced to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu by his friends Scott Thompson and R.J Nebe who were the first blue belts in the midwest under the legendary Rickson Gracie. Renzo Gracie came to Omaha to train with Mick at the gym as did John Lewis and Igor Zinoviev. In 1998 Mick wanted to test his new found skills of grappling and No Holds Barred fighting with a real competition and won the Budokai Bare Knuckle Challenge in Springfield Missouri. Also in 1998, Mick won the Grand Championship Belt at Bas Rutten’s U.S. Open Jui Jitsu/ Tough Man Tournament in Denver, Colorado. His last full contact fight was in Beijing China in 1999 as part of the first professional mixed martial arts fight ever done in China. Since retiring from competition Mick has devoted his energies to continuing his advancement as a Martial Artist and a coach. He currently holds the rank of Brown Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under Master Fabio Santos who is one of the highest ranking students of Rickson Gracie. He strives to teach people the life’s lessons he has learned from years of constantly challenging and pushing himself to be the best. The odds have always been stacked against him. From being blind in one eye, to immigrating to the U.S. at the age of 18, unsure of what his future in this country would hold. Mick has faced all these challenges with the courage and determination of a modern day warrior. . He is currently the head coach of the National amateur Mixed Martial Arts team and has trained more National champions than any other coach in the United States. To date, he has coached 37 National Champions and cornered 6 World Champions. His seminars and fighter coaching sessions and methods are among the best in the world. He has lived his life by the Samurai maxim “everything, everybody, outside of myself is my teacher”.";"http://www.mickdoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/md_logo.png";"http://www.mickdoyle.com/programs/";"Our youth program is based on the teachings and drills of Gan Teora.

The children progress through a belt system but unlike some Martial Arts schools we do not believe that a child or parent should be bound to a long term contract that promises a black belt at the end of a year or two.

One is able to force an adversary to quit attacking through the use of various joint manipulations, joint locks, and also a variety of chokes.  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has grown in popularity over the years as it is also practiced as a sport where two people display their skills in an attempt to gain superior positions for points all the way to ending the match thru a variety of submission holds. The use of Jiu-Jitsu can also be displayed in today’s sport of Mixed Martial Arts.  Traditionally, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is taught with students wearing a GI or Kimono.  This is what the uniform is called that students wear.  The art is also taught where students wear just shorts and t-shirt to give a different look to what may apply in an everyday setting.  This is called NO GI as a student is not wearing the GI to train in. There is a belt ranking system in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu which is as follows:  White, Blue, Purple, Brown, and Black.  Each belt has 4 degrees or stripes within it that one achieves on their way to the next belt level.  Students should expect to be very patient when it comes to promotion in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as many practitioners take 10 to 12 years to obtain a black belt.

We are all aware of what a quality martial arts program can provide - confidence, respect, focus, self-discipline, and so much more. However, here at Bodyworks we have taken it one step further. Not only does our program prioritize instilling these important attributes into our students, but we do so while developing “Martial Athletes” What is a “Martial Athlete?” A martial athlete by our definition is a student that possesses the stand-up self-defense skills of a karate student, ground defense skills of a Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, striking ability of a kickboxer and the movement ability of a field sport athlete. We want our students to be as well-rounded as possible which means providing a complete and comprehensive self-defense system that will prepare them mentally and physically for whatever obstacles they may encounter. Classes will teach your child: Effective stand-up striking skills; Effective stand-up self-defense techniques; Effective ground defense skills. We know that the more we enhance a student’s athletic ability the better chance they have to be successful not just here in martial arts, but in other sports/activities as well. This is why we developed and incorporated a “Youth Movement Specialization Program” in our gym as part of our regular martial arts program. Here your child will develop athletic qualities such as: Coordination; Static/Dynamic Stability; Agility; Speed; Endurance; Upper Body Strength; Lower Body Strength; Core Stability. ALL WHILE HAVING FUN! What other program, activity or sport can instill focus, respect, confidence, self-discipline and a sense of goal setting while at the same developing self-defense skills and improving athletic ability…..we do not believe there is one and is why we want to hear from you right now to begin your child’s journey to success!

Manchester New Hampshire housed several competitors who were known better around the world than in their own town. We teach to all ages and levels of fitness.

Soke Ray trained at this early age under Sensei Cisco at the Davidson Community Center where he studied the art of Shotokan Karate. He then began to study under Sensei Michael in the art of Freestyle Karate. Sensei Michael was a NYC Guardian Angel who taught Soke Ray to blend multiple karate systems that were being utilized at the Guardian Angels training facility. At the age of fifteen, Soke Ray began boxing at the PAL center on 183rd Street and Webster Avenue in the Bronx under Coach Rick. Soke Ray relocated to Bayonne, NJ and continued his training in Isshinryu Karate under Shihan Jerry Tardi and Shihan George Strydio. Soke Ray earned his second degree black belt in Isshinryu Karate in 2002 as well as his San Dan 3rd degree black belt in Japanese Jujitsu under Shihan Jerry Tardi and Grand Master Soke Joseph Miller in 2005. Soke Ray has trained in multiple disciplines such as Japanese Jujitsu, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, American Wrestling, Freestyle Submission Grappling, Judo, Kali, Street Fighting, Karate and Boxing. In 2005 Soke Ray was granted his right of passage to create his own system of self-defense and granted his Soke-ship under Soke Joseph Miller (TAI ZAN RYU GOSHIN JITSU). Soke Ray continues to train and attend seminars in quest of new knowledge and technique. “Every discipline of martial art has something to offer and only a misguided practitioner would think different”. – Soke Ray. Soke’s philosophy of martial arts was that every art represented a quarter in a dollar, and in order to be capable of defending yourself from any compromising position you need to incorporate these arts. Senshi Tori Mixed Martial Arts was the vision of Soke Ray Rivera to blend each discipline in which he trained. Senshi Tori MMA is a blending of boxing, kick boxing, Japanese jujitsu, judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and submission grappling.

In the United States, in every nine seconds, a woman is assaulted or beaten which makes Jiu Jitsu a recommended form of self defense. Nothing can be more comforting than to choke a possible assailant. Wouldn't these be enough reasons for stepping in the mats? But wait, there's more. BJJ is about friendship and respect as much as it is about self defense. You can be the positive role model for the younger girls while they get to learn and respect others. From our personal experience we have seen that the friendship between the jiujiteiras is stronger than most friendship created in gyms. BJJ training is the most effective self defense martial arts in the world, and perfect martial arts for kids, teens and women. We have an extensive woman's program that continues to grow.

We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus!

Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents.

Steve Hall Beginning his journey in the martial arts at the age of 11, by 17 years old Steve had earned his first black belt in Tae Kwon Do under the Western Masters System in Salisbury, Maryland. He moved to Florida in 1998 and started training Judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) with Bill Murphy and Marcio Simas and received the blue and purple belts under the Gracie Barra system. Bill stepped down in 2002 and now 3rd Degree Black Belt, Charles dos Anjos, took over as head instructor of the Sarasota school. Under his tutelage, Steve received the brown and black belts from Master Royce Gracie. All of Steve’s belts (including he black belt) have also been endorsed by the Florida Federation of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. For the past 15 years, Steve has focused most of his training on BJJ, Judo and American Wrestling. In October of 2006, was when he was awarded the rank of black belt by Master Royce, the son of the founder of Gracie Jiu Jitsu (GJJ), Grand Master Helio Gracie (1913-2009). In January of 2010 Steve was promoted to the rank of Instructor, and August of 2011 to First Degree Black Belt by Professor Charles dos Anjos. In April of 2013 Professor dos Anjos awarded Steve with the Second Degree on his Black Belt, making him one of the highest ranked American BJJ Black Belts in the country. With the Second Degree also comes the Title of Professor. Steve still keeps in close contact with Professor dos Anjos returning to Florida to train and teach several times a year. BJJ Lineage: Mitsuyo Maeda > Helio Gracie > Royce Gracie / Charles dos Anjos > Steve Hall. At the time Steve was only the 9th Royce Gracie black belt given in the world, as well as his fastest black belt at just eight years of training. Steve is still very competitive in the jiu-jitsu community, and has placed in many regional and international tournaments and competed in invitation-only superfights. He supports the growth of the sport as the Head Referee for the North American Grappling Association. He travels internationally with NAGA and has worked with the company for over 12 years, including teaching seminars to the competitors for many of the tournaments. Steve also regularly teaches seminars to many Royce Gracie network schools, several local and Fight To Win Affiliate schools and Military / Law Enforcement in North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland and Florida. Since moving to North Carolina in 2007 Steve now runs one of the largest and most successful BJJ teams in the Charlotte area and has lead his team to win several MMA fights, and countless World, National, State and regional medals in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. He is known for being one of the most technical instructors in the Carolinas, and Fight To Win was named “The Best School In he South East” by the North American Grappling Association.

Using our proven techniques your child will be able to defend themselves from bullies even though we do not teach them how to strike. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a fantastic way to promote an active and healthy lifestyle for kids of any ages. Parents of our students often find that their children gain self-esteem through athletic achievement and learn how to carry themselves better in situations that require them to deal with pressure. If your son or daughter is acting overly aggressive in school, lacks focus and or discipline then we recommend you start them out with a private lesson to introduce them to the sport and class structure. They will learn that Commitment, Respect, Focus, Self-Discipline and effort always make a rewarding experience and bring positive results. Besides self defense skills that will give children a high degree of self confidence. Our Kids and Juniors programs will also work on: Developing listening, obedience and focusing skills; Improving social skills; Improving self-control, respect and discipline; Increasing physical attributes such as hand-eye coordination, strength, agility and flexibility. What makes Gracie Jiu-Jitsu so effective for kids is the fact that instead of learning moves through katas or prearranged set of movements carried out on a cooperative training partner, they will learn how to apply grappling techniques on a resisting training partner who’s not cooperating and is counteracting with his own moves, much like as what you’d see on the streets.";;;"Judo";;"https://rdacademyofselfdefense.com/schedule/";;"Woody Bostic";;"info@rdacademyofselfdefense.com";"https://www.facebook.com/rdacademyofselfdefense";;;;1;;

Self Confidence - For many children, self confidence doesn’t come naturally. Confidence is developed over a period of time. As a child accomplishes new goals, his or her confidence level increases. Children become more self confident in Martial Arts because they progress at their own pace and are not compared to others. Better Grades - Being a Martial Artist also means being a better student. Every child learns to follow directions, pay attention in class and participate in class activities. These skills help them to become better students. Coordination - Martial Arts challenges the entire body, developing coordination, balance, agility and poise. These traits are often neglected and not fully developed in team sports. Discipline - Martial Arts will help your child to discover that through self-discipline and perseverance he or she can accomplish almost anything. Self Defense - Martial Arts teaches children to think instead of panic in potentially serious situations as well as how to react to threats from other kids.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or BJJ is a martial art like Karate and has been proven to be great for kids teaching them confidence, control and discipline while helping them gain better fitness. While Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art like Karate it has some interesting differences. Karate uses punches and kicks mostly for self defense but instead Brazilian Jiu Jitsu teaches kids to use holds like wrestling to escape, defend and safely protect themselves in the same situations. Karate uses sparring with punches and kicks as part of the training but instead Brazilian Jiu Jitsu uses games we call “rolling” which are safe and fun sessions similar to wrestling without the punches and kicks. In Karate you are taught to maintain a distance so you can punch and kick but in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu you learn to close the distance and use leverage to overpower and subdue your opponent.Teaching kids to do this helps them to understand their personal space and to feel comfortable getting out of situations without having to punch or kick to do so. At Schell Shock BJJ in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina we love kids martial arts. John Schell, the head instructor has raised four kids of his own in fact.

We have kids that have been training for years that leave to top colleges and universities in the country, thanks in part to the discipline and focus on hard work they learned through martial arts. This is something we take a great amount of pride in. There are always new generations of individuals and families coming in to pursue the ongoing legacy. It is a tradition in martial arts to pass down the knowledge one receives in their training and many students become instructors, often ending up owning their own schools. It is our goal to inspire strength, discipline, confidence and focus in our students, to help them discover their inner leader. I believe every child has the potential to be a leader, they just need someone to believe in them. I understand the challenges of raising a confident and focused child in an age where there are more distractions than ever. Learning alongside your children is a great way bond and grow with them.

Making matters worse is the fact that bullying goes virtually unaccounted for, with less than 15% of children actually reporting the abuse. Bullies rely on fear tactics, coercion and intimidation to gain power. They assert dominance over their victims through repeated acts of aggressive behavior, inflicting both physical and mental harm. Though it is common knowledge that the only way to defeat bullies is to stand up to them, most children feel incapable of confronting their tormentors because of an overwhelming concern for their personal safety.

Having been modified from its original Japanese form, Gracie Jiu-jitsu is perfect for everyone regardless of age, skill, or athletic ability. Although it consists of over 600 techniques, studies of real fights conducted by members of the Gracie Family have shown that 36 techniques have been used more often and with greater success than all the other techniques combined. This lead to the birth of the Gracie Combatives program. Originally designed for the US Army, Combatives is the perfect program for effective and efficient self defense learning.";;"https://sites.google.com/view/minotgjj/gracie-bullyproof";"Studies suggest that bullying may be the leading cause of low self-esteem in children, and according to some surveys, less than 15% of kids actually report acts of bullying. Children's inability to stand up to a bully is rooted in profound fear for their personal safety. Ironically, the victims know that they must confront the bully and would like nothing more than to stand up to them. But, they simply can't follow through for fear of the physical harm that backs the bully's every action. And, therein lies the challenge - how do you instill in a victim of bullying the confidence to face the tormentor, look them in the eye, and back them down? The answer is simple - teach the victims to defend themselves against physical attack, and the rest will follow. Most martial arts programs rely on striking the attacker with violent punches, kicks, knees, and elbows, but in the Gracie Bullyproof program we take a different approach. All the techniques are purely defensive and utilize no strikes. Furthermore, we teach children how to defuse confrontations with words and never to initiate physical aggression. If attacked, we offer techniques to non-violently neutralize the threat and gain control until help arrives. In the Gracie Bullyproof program, we teach the children how to fight fire with water so that you never have to worry about your child becoming a bully under our guidance. The Gracie Bullyproof program prepares your child using a three-pronged approach:  Increased Awareness: Harassment comes in many forms. Sometimes, a victim doesn’t take a stand because they can’t differentiate between “joking” and “bullying.” We teach your child to differentiate between harmless play and harmful harassment so they know precisely when and how to act in each circumstance. Unshakable Confidence: A confident child is a Bullyproof child. Bullies seek “easy targets” – those who will tolerate their abuse. We arm your child with the tools needed to overcome physical, verbal, and psychological harassment, so they are so confident in themselves that no bully will try to harass them. Total Responsibility: We prepare your child to deal with bullies without turning them into one. We emphasize discipline, responsibility, and respect throughout the course, and teach five “Rules of Engagement” to ensure they never abuse their power.";"https://sites.google.com/view/minotgjj/women-empowered";"Women Empowered is the official Gracie self-defense program for women. In this 10-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 15 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to Pink Belt! If you have no previous martial arts experience and you want to learn how to defend yourself in a fun, safe, and cooperative learning environment, Women Empowered is for you.

"Flow Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu";"https://www.flowmma.org/";(760) 799-4760;"140 Monadnock Highway";"Swanzey";"NH";"03446";;"United States";"Practitioners at Flow are welcome at all ages and levels of physical condition.  Beginners are welcome at any time.  Feel free to come in and watch a class! Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a grappling rather than striking art and “submissions” are won by implied rather than sustained damage. Though injuries can occur in any sport, practitioners (once they reach a level of proficiency) are generally able to practice sparring at 100% of sporting intensity without sustaining injury.  Similar to the moment in Chess when the King is retired by the losing player rather than being removed from the board, the game of Jiu-Jitsu is won when a player acknowledges that to continue would cause injury or (in the case of a choke) unconsciousness. Many comparisons have been made between Chess and Jiu-Jitsu, including the need to stay current on technical developments, and exhaustively study opening movements and refutations.  The renowned Chess Champion, Josh Waitzkin–an innovator of tutorial Chess software–is currently working with Jiu-Jitsu Champion Marcelo Garcia to develop an instructional website which merges Josh’s highly developed method of Chess study with the game of Jiu-Jitsu. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was made hugely popular by the Gracie family in the early nineties with the advent of the first UFC event.  In a single elimination contest that involved eight fighters from various styles (western boxing, sumo, Muay Thai, etc) and had limited rules, Royce Gracie easily took each fighter apart with a style of Jiu-Jitsu, almost completely consisting of ground-based grappling techniques.   This was a defining moment for BJJ, an art that had not yet gained wide recognition outside of Brazil.  Renowned martial artists of traditional disciplines noted Royce Gracie’s calm and unflappable demeanor, while young enthusiasts flocked in droves to learn everything they could about this newly discovered style. Over almost twenty years Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and what has come to be known as MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) have redefined how many people view the martial and fighting arts.  They have spawned, with renewed enthusiasm, a thousand more tired discussions attempting to distinguish the ultimate and most effective martial art.  In forums around the Internet and in after-class debates every possible scenario is analyzed to determine which martial art would prevail–as if martial arts were entities of their own, existing apart from the body of practitioners. What is largely underappreciated about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu when viewed in this light, is its unrivaled sophistication as a martial sport, or game.  Several years ago Rigan Machado produced a three volume encyclopedia of Jiu-Jitsu sweeps, submissions and counters.  While a remarkable resource, the encyclopedia was by no way exhaustive and since publication technical innovations and developments have continued to refine and improve the art of Jiu-Jitsu.  Much of this innovation is due to the health of Jiu-Jitsu as a sport/game both in organized competitions and within the school in sparring sessions. Undoubtedly, an athlete interested in MMA competition will want to study Jiu-Jitsu, and Jiu-Jitsu is probably a good fit for those interested in self defense, but a level of expertise in Jiu-Jitsu will take quite a few years to develop–and mastery of such a highly technical art could take well over a decade. The practice of Jiu-Jitsu can be physically and psychologically demanding–requiring a high level of focus and exertion which, for most practitioners, becomes its own reward.  As with any discipline it seems always to be the practitioners that love to practice who become great at the art.";"https://i0.wp.com/www.flowmma.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-flow-word-logotr3.png?fit=850%2C850";;;;;;;"http://www.flowmma.org/schedule/";;;;"flowmma@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/Flow.JiuJitsu/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPtvwJ6GULRuSVXewCy6IzQ";"https://youtu.be/uQQnkOq_byw";;1;;

The art was derived from the Japanese martial arts of judo and Jujitsu. The most important element of BJJ that separates it from its Japanese counterparts is its effective use of positional dominance over the opponent. BJJ can teach a smaller, weaker person to successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique to apply joint locks and chokeholds. In traditional sport BJJ a kimono (gi) is worn. The kimono serves more as a tool than a uniform. The kimono is constructed of very thick material which is resistant to tearing and allows the BJJ player to utilize it as a means to control the opponent. It also allows for use of various “cloth chokes” which can be used to defeat an opponent. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self defense. Sparring (commonly referred to as “rolling”) and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition, in relation to progress and ascension through it’s ranking system.";;;;;;;;;;;;"drbazzani@bazzanichiropractic.com";"https://www.facebook.com/nashuabjj/";;;;1;;
