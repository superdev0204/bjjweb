"Fudo Shintai Aikido";"http://www.fudoshintaiaikido.com/";(951) 201-8358;"502 S. Vicentia";"Corona";"CA";92882;;"United States";"Elise and Robert Simmons laid the foundation of this school in the late Fifties. From 1958 to 1966 Bob and Elise worked with then famous martial artist and author, Bruce Tegner in Hollywood, CA. In 1964 they formed Simmons Martial Arts offering institutional and private instruction, a tradition that carries through to this day. In 1966, they brought it to Corona, working with the Parks and Recreation Department. This allowed them to offer high quality, low cost training to the citizens of Corona. They also opened The UC Irvine Aikido Club. Robert and Elise named the school in Corona Chisai Raion, teaching Judo and Jujutsu, Yoseikan Aikido, and a mix of Shotokan and Kenpo Karate. 1967 was the year that Chisai Raion officially joined the Aikikai under the direction of Koichi Tohei, head instructor at the Hombu Dojo in Tokyo. In 1968 Kendo and Iaido were added to the curriculum. Chisai Raion aligned their instruction with Takemusu Aikido in 1976. This follows Morihito Saito’s instruction at the Iwama Dojo. Iwama dojo, one of the oldest Aikido Dojos, is where O’sensei resided, spending the last 27 years of his life. In 1983 Robert Simmons began to reviewed his body of knowledge in all of these disciplines and decided to codify them into a style that would become Enmeikan or Clear Circle School. It took 10 years to distill his knowledge, and in 1993 Chisai Raion became Enmeikan. In 2000, Robert decided to retire from active instruction with Enmeikan Aikido. The Corona dojo was released to two of his best students, Dr. Thomas Van Cise and Terry McCarthy. A new name was required and Tom and Terry formed Fudo Shin Tai or Immovable Mind and Body Aikido starting in 2001. The curriculum was mostly Aikido and Aikido weapons practice. The caveat, was that the techniques had to be effective in the street. Sensei Elise stayed on as a consultant to the school. 2006, January 16th to be exact, we lost Sensei Robert Simmons at the age of 69. Four years later in December of 2010, we lost Sensei Thomas Van Cise. Sensei Terry McCarthy became the head instructor at the school 2011. His extensive background in martial arts, law enforcement and military service, is shaping the school to what it is now. The last three years, Fudo Shin Tai Aikido has embraced techniques from Judo, Jujutsu, and Yoshinkan Aikido. Demonstrations have been held for the school in Escrima, Pencak Silat and Lima Lama. Sensei Elise, our founder and curriculum consultant, still attends and instructs, both in Aikido and in a womens' self-defense class in our dojo. Both Sensei Elise and Sensei Terry have been available for private instruction. For five decades, thousands of students, young and old, male and female, from construction workers to congressmen, this school had taught them all.

"CrossFit Proper";"http://www.crossfitproper.com/";(951) 316-3323;"430 Princeland Ct";"Corona";"CA";92879;;"United States";"CrossFit Proper was established in January 2009 from the pure love of CrossFit. We initially heard about CrossFit by watching a video of the young BJ Penn doing a muscle-up demo with Coach Glassman. It took about another two years before we would even try it because the workouts on CrossFit.com were seemingly impossible. In 2008 a garage gym opened up in Anaheim Hills called Canyon CrossFit. We were probably one of their first clients. Within months of training with Canyon CrossFit, Christian, who was then sixteen years old, asked to go to CrossFit Trainers Certification. As parents, we truly believe our jobs are to allow our kids to find their path and feed whatever sparks their interests and makes them happy. We contacted CrossFit HQ to find out if there was an age limit to certification. There was not. And so, Christian went to cert in San Diego, CA in which Dave Castro was the lead instructor. During cert in the good old days, you had to do Fran and Fight Gone Bad…all in one weekend. It was Christian’s first Fran and first Fight Gone Bad…both at Rx’d weights. Needless to say, that tough weekend did not discourage him, it only fed his desire to continue his CrossFit and spread his love for fitness and training people of all ages and abilities. He started training us – mom, dad and sis. Within a few months, Christian wanted to become an official CrossFit affiliate. As parents, we still think we are crazy for telling him this, “You can affiliate if you do all the work. Fill out the application and write the essay.” It didn’tdidn’t long. Within a week, he had filled out the application and wrote the essay. We became affiliated in January 2009. We are still wondering if he is the youngest affiliate owner in the history of CrossFit. Then, a few more family members and some friends came to train. We put up a pull-up bar in the garage, bought a plastic sprinkler garden box to jump on, bought some rings and some cheap barbells and weights. Our first rack was fashioned from plumbing pipes so that it could double as parallettes. We followed main site WODs and did what we could. Unfortunately, we only lasted a few months in our garage gym because the neighbors called the police on us due to the loud music and “noise” that goes on when people are busy getting better. Throughout this time, our daughter, Charisse had been a dance major and fitness instructor at UCLA’s John Wooden Center. Of course, her classes were run with the CrossFit methodology. Carissa started and finished nursing school, earning her RN license. And, Jesse held the fort down making sure everyone accomplished their goals. Since January of 2009, we have gone through many changes starting in our garage, graduating into a 1000 square foot warehouse, knocking down a wall to expand into another 1000 square feet, then 10,00 sq. ft, and finally in 2016 we are in an intimate, private 3300 sq. ft. facility. We are thankful every day for the wonderful, positive members that have become our family at Proper. Our “family” continues to grow in membership and coaching staff. Christian continues to expand his knowledge of health and fitness and is an alumni of California Baptist University with a Major in Kinesiology.";"http://www.crossfitproper.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cfp-header3-new.gif";"http://www.crossfitproper.com/fitness-coach-in-corona-ca/";"CrossFit Kids in Corona, CA make fitness FUN.

The art was based on early 20th Century Kodokan Judo, which was itself then a recently-developed system (founded in 1882), based on multiple schools (or Ryu) of Japanese Jujutsu. It promotes the principle that a smaller, weaker person using leverage and proper technique can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger assailant. BJJ can be trained for self-defense, sport grappling (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition. Sparring (commonly referred to as ""rolling"") and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu emphasizes ground fighting techniques and sumission holds involving joint-locks and chokeholds also found in numerous other arts with or without ground fighting emphasis. The premise is that most of the advantage of a larger, stronger opponent comes from superior reach and more powerful strikes, both of which are somewhat negated when grappling on the ground. BJJ permits a wide variety of techniques to take the fight to the ground after taking a grip. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of maneuvers (and counter-maneuvers) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of submission technique. Acheiving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of the BJJ Style, and includes effective use of the guard position to defend oneself from bottom, and passing the guard to dominate from top position with side control, mount, and back mount positions. This system of maneuvering and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic chess when utilized by two experienced practitioners. A submission hold is the equivalent of checkmate.";"http://www.boranjj.com/images/boranjj_logo.jpg";;;;;;"$120.00 one-time registration fee which includes a FREE gi; Adults $150 per month - unlimited training; Private Lessons - $100.00 per hour; 2 Person Private Lessons - $120.00 per hour; Kid's Class age 4 - 15 $100.00 per month - 6 days a week";"http://www.boranjj.com/schedule.htm";;"James Boran";"First class is FREE!";"avalanchenyc@sbcglobal.net";"https://www.facebook.com/Boran-Jiu-Jitsu-307350909454354/";;"https://youtu.be/MkfCGN_utEQ";;1;221;

Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do reforms not just the body but the spirit as well using both the feet and the hands to attack and defend.​ The skills and techniques used in Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do balance the body by improving the flexibility in all areas while using the bare hands and feet in combat. This helps in showing more power and a variety of feet techniques compared to other martial arts. Tae Kwon Do is one of the world’s strongest martial arts when it comes to feet techniques for attack and defense but with Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do  defensive skills are used first for a formidable attack. This makes Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do trainers learn not to attack and overcome others but instead to build a noble character, thus building a martial art that is based on peace, fairness, respect and love. Children and young adults that learn Tae Kwon Do will build healthy values and leadership, including an understanding that self control which comes from practice and patience. Practitioners will learn that all things can be united with a repetition of life skills through Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do and help educate in having a virtuous and spiritual life in martial arts.

"Wolfpac Combat Ju-Jitsu";;(310) 938-8955;"316 W Beach Ave";"Inglewood";"CA";90302;;"United States";"Welcome to Wolfpac Military Combat Ju-Jitsu. Since 2005, Wolfpac Combat Ju-Jitsu has been providing instruction in Military Combat Ju-Jitsu and Mixed martial arts to Military units all over the state of California. This is the Home of The WolfPac Combat Ju-Jitsu Academy and 4th Military Police CSMR Combat Martial Arts training teams. What is Military Combat Ju-Jitsu? The system of Military Combat Ju-Jitsu is a mixed hybrid form of many grappling and striking art forms. The Military Combat Ju-Jitsu system was created using only the most effective techniques found in Traditional Japanese Jujitsu, Judo, Aikido, Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu, Russian Sambo Combat Wrestling, Muay Thai,  Kenpo Karate and the U.S. Army Combatives Fighting System. The Military Combat Ju-Jitsu system Was created for one purpose, Survival and dominance in combat. Most traditional martial arts are used by many entities  for self-defense. Military Combat Ju-jitsu is at the opposite end of the spectrum from self-defense. Self-defense techniques are designed to repel an attack and allow escape from harm. Military Combat Jujitsu techniques are meant for closing with the opponent and to allow for complete dominance of the situation. A Quick Study in Combatives. What can you do to maintain your own personal protection? Here are some general pointers when it comes to self-defense:  1. Situational Awareness. Look for trouble before it comes to you. Watch out for those with cloaked weapons, such as knifes, and be aware of peoples body language or attitude that convey danger.  2. Be Ready to Move Fast. A typical knife fight lasts 3 to 5 seconds. In close quarters, there may not be time and room to use a rifle or handgun. Be prepared to evade and counterattack. If you have to, improvise by using environmental items within reach to defend yourself or attack. 3. Keep Techniques Simple. Whether on defense or offense, use simple, direct, hard and effective punches, kicks and other moves. Dont waste motion. No fancy stuff. 4. Practice in Realistic Scenarios. In training, try to create the sights, sounds and feel of real-life situations, such as a street scene. Then learn to analyze, communicate and use appropriate force to achieve a successful outcome.";;;;;;;;;;"SSG (Ret) D. Wilkins";;"nishkambjj@yahoo.com";;;;;1;316;

Here are several reasons why Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is one of the safest forms for children to begin their journey into the world of martial arts: It is a non-violent, yet effective and complete self-defense system. Many parents want their child to learn a martial art in order to defend herself/himself against bullies or unwanted strangers. Having a safe and systematic foundation of self-defense is key for children to feel confident, specifically about defending themselves, if necessary. Since it is completely based in leverage and submission, BJJ technique actually gives the smaller opponent an advantage. There is no kicking or punching involved, unlike many other martial arts. It is a natural martial art, based on leverage and balance. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu uses the principles of action – reaction, leverage, and base. Children learn to use an opponent’s power as an advantage, rather than fighting against the force. We practice many different games that help children experience these principles and learn to understand how to use them as techniques. Children develop a heightened sense of body awareness and coordination, which leads to self-confidence and inner discipline. Not only do children learn how to effectively defend themselves, but also strengthen their kinesthetic abilities to excel in any other sport of which they participate. It doesn’t have to be a choice of one sport or the other";;;"Sub Grappling";;"https://www.cobrinhabjj.com/schedule/";;"Rubens Charles Maciel";;"info@cobrinhabjj.com";"https://www.facebook.com/CobrinhaBJJ/";"https://www.youtube.com/user/Cobrinhabjj";"https://youtu.be/NA0awlSrOPU";"Rubens Charles Maciel: CBJJO World Champion (2005); IBJJF World Champion (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2017); IBJJF World No Gi Champion (2007, 2008, 2011, 2012); ADCC Champion (2013, 2015, 2017)";1;118;

We believe that empowering women with the knowledge and confidence that it takes to know that they can defend themselves against a male attacker could transform them forever.  We discuss how simple awareness could be the difference between being a victim of an attack and avoiding it all together. We discuss how to identify a possible attacker and how to deal with that face to face and physical confrontation that could arise.  We also discuss and teach defenses to the most common attack scenarios for women that are attacked by men. Most martial arts will teach women that just punching and kicking is a realistic solution or even an efficient form of self defense. At times, at even more scary rates, women have the belief that hitting an attacker in the groin is a good enough solution to a bad situation. None of these options are reliable and effective. As a matter fact, hitting someone in the groin is possibly the thing that women can do in a real life-threatening situation. Our Jiu-Jitsu classes aren't only the most effective martial art in the world, but we also have BEST self defense classes for women because we teach women how to defend themselves by using timing and leverage.

At our Academies, we focus on the team; Meaning you, the student. Not everyone has the same reasons for training in the Martial Arts. Some enjoy the exercise, others want to learn self-defense, and some may wish to pursue a career in MMA or competition. The philosophy of this Team is to teach functional Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu that you will keep with you for the rest of your life. You will not get watered down technique, or be taught how to win a tournament without knowing how to defend yourself on the street.  We will teach you to be comfortable anywhere, with or without strikes; on the feet, on the ground, off your back, how to control the situation, and how to have fun while learning it! Many of our students are Law Enforcement, Mixed Martial Artists and members of the Armed Forces.  People have diverse needs; that is why we have assembled equally diverse resources for the students at our school. We are led by Black Belt Professor, Clark Gracie, who is the grandson of Carlos Gracie, the founder of this Martial Art.  Clark is the only Gracie family member living in San Diego who is teaching and still competing regularly, and winning! Carlos Gracie is the older brother and teacher of Helio Gracie. Between the two of them, they developed the most efficient fighting system ever created, Brazilian (Gracie) Jiu Jitsu.  They were able to defeat all different challengers, big and small of all other martial arts. Clark’s father, Carley Gracie, is known as the “Lion of the Gracie family” and earned his black belt from his father, Carlos Gracie.  Carley Gracie is the last of the Gracie fighters to be personally trained and coached by Carlos Gracie.  Carley Gracie is now an 9th Degree Red Belt. Carlos taught the art of style, skill, thought and technique. His style and success was not developed through brute strength and aggressive power but rather, formulated from an almost scientific process of maneuvering, patience, flexibility, diet, strength of mind, strength of will, and self control. Clark earned his black belt under his father. Like his father, Clark practices and teaches techniques that rely on position and leverage.  At our academy, we teach that small details are very important to get the full advantage of the technique. Our instructors are hands-on teachers, often rolling with students of various ranks and skill levels. We teach philosophy, focusing on clearly explaining the principles of the techniques of Gracie Jiu Jitsu, in a way that people can understand.  We then incorporate drills that help students internalize those techniques in order to use them in live situations.";"http://clarkgracie.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/clarkGracie_logo.png";"http://clarkgracie.com/about/";"Lil Lions - Ages 4-6.

Atos was founded by two friends who shared the same religious beliefs and an intense passion for Jiu-Jitsu. The word “Atos” is the Portuguese word for “acts,”, which specifically references “The Book of Acts” in the bible, based on the belief that “God can do amazing things through ordinary people, when He empowers them through His Spirit.” Today, the Atos jiu-jitsu association members and competitors continue to spread thier innovative style of jiu-jitsu across the world.

His family made a living as rice farmers. When Bunkerd was just 11 years old, he was forced to quit school and get a job. At the same time, he started competing in small Muay Thai fights around the country for extra money. His first fight brought in the equivalent of one American dollar. Bunkerd dreamed of becoming a great Muay Thai fighter, which would bring his family money and fame. Because he was shorter than the average fighter of his weight class, not too many people believed this dream was possible. At 18, Bunkerd made off to Bangkok to try his luck in joining aMuay Thai training camp. Phillip Wong, of Fairtex, Thailand was the one who gave him his first break. Bunkerd proved all his doubters wrong and became a great champion – winning two of the most prestigious championships—one at the famed Lumpinee stadium and another at Rajadmnerm Stadium. His dedication, strength, perseverance and success in the sport of Muay Thai brought him much recognition and fame. Eventually, in the year 1992, Bunkerd came to the United States to become one of the head trainers in the new Fairtex camp in Chandler, Arizona. Simultaneously, he became a well-known world champion in the U.S. Because of Bunkerd’s humble disposition and fierce fighting style, he became known as the “People’s Champion.” It was at this new U.S. facility that Chris Cariaso and Bunkerd first met. Chris, only 12 years old at this time, received a flyer about the Arizona gym while eating in a Thai restaurant with his mother. They immediately drove to the new facility and Chris became the very first student to sign up. Chris began training exclusively with Bunkerd. As a result, Chris excelled in this sport and began fighting at a very young age. Bunkerd and Chris became very close like father and son—Chris even lived at the gym for a period of time. Five years later, to the dismay of Chris and many other students, the gym closed down and the pair separated. At this time Bunkerd was moved around to many other gyms and Chris began pursuing another sport-BMX racing. A few years later, a twist of fate landed the two in San Francisco at the same time. Alex Gong had started a new Fairtex in San Francisco and Bunkerd again served as head trainer. Chris, after winning the World Cup in BMX racing, moved to the Bay Area with his brother. Chris showed up at the gym with a seriously broken arm and jaw that would force his BMX career to come to a screeching halt. Chris remembered the one sport that made him strong before and decided that training with Bunkerd again was the best way to rehabilitate. At the young age of 17, Chris became program director at the San Francisco Fairtex. Chris was a natural in this business and his enthusiasm about Muay Thai helped Alex’s business grow. Chris also began teaching classes and developed a following of dedicated private students. After the tragic death of Alex Gong in 2003, Bunkerd and Chris decided to strike out on their own. Bunkerd, now with three sons and a wife in America, wanted to fulfill a life-long dream of owning a gym. He and Chris aggressively pursued the business knowledge needed to make this dream a reality. Once again Bunkerd faced opposition with the cynical, and this time he was not alone. Many thought Chris was too young to lead this business venture, and Bunkerd could not be his own boss. The skeptics didn’t sway the pair and finally, the hard work paid off. One of Chris’ private students rented them a space at 734 Bryant St. in San Francisco. Fight and Fitness opened its doors on March 15, 2004 and began a thriving and beloved gym. In the age of the big corporate gym, many aspects about Fight and Fitness set it apart from the others. Fight and Fitness is family-owned and operated, and the positive atmosphere reflects that feeling. Every student is important to Bunkerd and Chris. Fight and Fitness gives every student the personal attention they deserve. The training is excellent for all ages and levels, and everyone is continually encouraged to do their personal best. Because of the opposition the two overcame, Bunkerd and Chris believe that anyone can achieve whatever they believe in. As long as you believe in yourself, they will help you achieve your goals. Their enthusiasm reflects this belief. The pair plan to expand the business, but never at the expense of losing the personal touch Fight and Fitness acquired.";"https://www.fightandfitness.com/fnf/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-cropped-RISEBANNERNAMECHANGE-3-e1506465561145.jpg";;;;;"Muay Thai, Boxing, MMA";"Gym Membership: $99 enrollment fee (one time fee), $159 per month (set up as auto bill pay); Prepaid Membership (no enrollment fee): Prepaid 12 months $1700 (save $307), Prepaid 6 months $900 (save $153); Pay As You Go Membership: $189.00 per month; Day passes: $25 introductory class, $35 drop-in day pass";"https://www.fightandfitness.com/fnf/schedule/";;"Christopher Cariaso";;"Chris@FightandFitness.com";"https://www.facebook.com/risecombatsf/";;;;1;143;

Every class at our academy will teach your child valuable new skills that can be applied on and off the mat. Not only that, they are going to have a lot of fun, too! Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu does not rely on brute strength or size in order to be effective. This makes it a great choice for kids. Parents can be assured that their kids will be effectively armed against bullying. Recent statistics show that at least 1 of 4 kids is bullied at school, with rates climbing to 9 out of 10 in some areas. It is also reported that 160,000 students avoid going to school on any given day in order to escape bullying. Up to 80% of confrontations with bullies turn physical. BJJ can help keep your kids safe and teach them how to successfully diffuse a situation until help comes along, all without having to resort to seriously injuring anyone. What many parents love most about our kids’ Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu classes is the miraculous change they see in their kids’ attitudes. Principals are a big part of our kids’ program, where the students will learn not only to be more confident but also gain valuable character skills such as respect, discipline, loyalty, and teamwork. They learn how to work towards goals and develop a passion for something positive. Healthy living is central to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu philosophy. Enrolling them in a BJJ class is an incredible gift which can give them a great start to life and teach them the importance of staying in shape, as well as eating properly. A healthy body and a healthy mind go hand in hand. Those who become lifelong practitioners will realize many health benefits and avoid many medical conditions others suffer. Studies show that kids who train in martial arts are less likely to give into peer pressure, which can save much heartache as they grow. Additionally, Parenting Magazine has reported, “Martial arts actually helps teach self-discipline and socialization skills. In fact, many parents whose children have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report great success with these programs because self-control and concentration are exactly the skills underdeveloped in ADHD kids.” Chief instructor Romulo Melo began training at a very early age himself and he would love to speak with you in person about the transformation he has seen in his own life, as well as what he has witnessed through training many other kids over the years.";;;;;"https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/mainclass";;"Romulo Melo";;"info@RomuloMeloBJJ.com";"https://www.facebook.com/Romulo-Melo-Brazilian-Jiu-Jitsu-395701027149582/";;"https://youtu.be/QAGQczh2qsQ";;1;148;

We started as ""Skidrow Dojo"" in the back of a photo studio on Sixth Street in San Francisco February 1986. A group of artists & Punks asked Jimmy Friedman AKA; ""Jim Bone"" to teach them self-defense shortly after the violent murder of a loved one. Classes began in the shadow of tragedy, and Aikido in a small way helped heal the suffering these people were going through. Beginning as a club for that group of around ten friends, the dojo soon outgrew the Sixth Street studio and relocated to 759 Harrison Street in San francisco, California where it remained for three years. In 1989 we moved to 57B Stillman Street were we remained until 1999. In 1999 we moved to 141 11th Street. Peter Ralls Sensei has assisted and been an instructor at SKIDROW DOJO from 1986-2018. He has dedicated his time and Aikido knowledge to the Dojo for over 30 years. We very grateful for his commitment to us over the years. Since 1986 the Dojo has hosted many of the world's highest ranking Aikido instructors, including Kato Hiroshi Sensei, Christian Tissier Sensei, Nishio Sensei, Anno Sensei, P. Hendricks Sensei, Sugawara Sensei, Terry Dobson Sensei, K. Cottier Sensei. After the 1989, San Franicisco earthquake, James moved the dojo a few blocks away to 57 Stillman Street, and it stayed at that location for ten years. In 1995 Kato Hiroshi Sensei was welcomed to San Francisco, and shortly thereafter ""Skidrow Dojo"" was renamed Suginami Akikai SF. Our present and final location at 141 11th street, between Mission and Howard streets, San Francisco, California. 11th Street Dojo has a live-in student (Uchi-Deshi) program. Applicants must have a least 6 months experience in Aikido or BJJ.

Maeda was able to get himself established with the help of a local business man, Gastão Gracie, and out of gratitude Maeda taught Gastão’s oldest son Carlos Jiu-Jitsu. Carlos Gracie was interested in the practical application of what he had learned in the “anything goes” environment of the street and refined Maeda’s techniques through numerous challenge matches. Carlos even took out an add in the local paper challenging all comers to fight regardless of their size or physical advantages. At a mere 135 pounds Carlos was able to utilize his technique to overcome all opponents and was never defeated. The refinement of technique through actual competition and the willingness to fight any challenger have become part of the Gracie family tradition. Carlos taught his Jiu-Jitsu to his brothers Oswaldo, Gastão, Jorge, Helio and to his older sons.  In turn they would go on to teach their sons, nephews, brothers, cousins and friends. Carlos himself had 21 children, creating a fighting dynasty in only a generation. Today the Graciefighter Team founded by Cesar Gracie continues the tradition of Jiu-Jitsu founded by Carlos by regularly having students compete at the highest levels of Mixed Martial Arts, submission grappling, and sport Jiu-Jitsu.";"http://graciefighter.com/graciefighter/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gracie-fighter.png";;;;;"Judo";;"http://graciefighter.com/locations/gracie-fighter-san-francisco/";;"Cesar Gracie";;;"https://www.facebook.com/GracieFighterSF/";;;;1;138;

Muay Thai, but more specifically Muay Boran and Lerdrit, run in his family for generations. His father was also a trainer and a referee in Lumpini and his uncle the same. His first lesson in Muay Boran was given to him when he was four years old. He was not a Muay Thai Champion. He immigrated to the United States at age seven. At the age of 18 Kru Sam then trained under Master Toddy, whose father knew his father, to become a Muay Thai trainer and teacher. Master Toddy taught Kru Sam an unbeatable system of teaching and continued to train him in this manner for 10 years. He also certified him as “Kru.” Because knowing how to fight does not always translate to knowing how to train others, Kru Sam’s innate ability to teach, his Muay Boran and Lerdrit background and certification from Master Toddy are keys to his success. Kru Sam brought Muay Thai to the Bay Area in 1991. He introduced the sport by fighting black belts in the Bay Area wherever he could. Word quickly spread and interest in the sport was immediately picked up by legends such as Sifu Harlan Lee, Sifu Shane Lacey and the Lozada family. SFPD Officer Paul Lozada gave Kru Sam his first teaching job at a small academy in downtown San Francisco. Kru Sam taught part time for years raising fighters, including Wrath James White, Alex Gong (RIP) and Richard Tan. They obtained most of their experience in gymnasiums. When Kru Sam opened up Team USA nearly 20 years ago, he raised his second generation of Champions – David Lau, Anthony Badua and John Ellcessor. These Champions were privileged to experience Muay Thai competitions in productions brought by BJohn Promotions, Scott Coker’s Strikeforce and Dennis Warner’s World Championship Muay Thai. In fact Kru Sam, along with Coach Cung Le and Professor Navarros, brought the first “smoker” to the Bay Area in 1995. Today, Kru Sam is on his fourth generation of Champions and the team continues to grow. With the legalization of MMA, Team USA expects to add its ground game and introduce a team of MMA fighters. For over 2 decades we’ve offered elite Muay Thai training in the San Francisco Bay Area. We teach Muay Thai and kickboxing through a highly organized curriculum that meets varying needs.

Furthermore, when parents try to do something on their own about what's happening to their child, they are the ones who get in trouble. What are they to do? The answer could simply be to change their child from the ""target"" list the bully has to the ""let's leave him/her alone"" list. What social scientists know is why bullies pick on certain kids. The bully knows they simply cannot defend themselves.

Whether your child can only train once a week or everyday we have the program that will fit your needs. All Smash kids instructor have full background checks and are eager to help students learn and develop. Everyday, approximately 150,000 kids miss school due to fear or intimidation of bullies. Unfortunately, this is happening to children as young as kindergarten age. Not only can bullying lead to low confidence and self-esteem issues, but it also causes children to dislike school at one of the most impressionable times in their lives. Can you imagine how it would feel to go to work every single day and be afraid for your own safety and well being? Many kids have that same feeling while going to school every day. How can we expect children to focus well on their academics when they are under such stress? While parents may expect the teachers to intervene, the increasing statistics in bullying over the years is a clear sign that school administration is not or cannot resolve the problem. You can absolutely do something to stop or prevent this from happening to your child. Give your child the ability to stand up for him or herself. Bullies prey on those who they perceive as weak. Training martial arts can give your child the real confidence to hold their head up high and not act like someone who is an easy target. In a vast majority of situations, that aura of confidence alone will cause bullies to stay away.";;;"Wrestling, Kickboxing, Judo, Strength and Conditioning, Bootcamp and Kettlebells, Personal Training, MMA";;"http://www.smashsanjose.com/schedule.php";;;"7 Day Free Trial";"sanjose@smashgyms.com";"https://www.facebook.com/smashsanjose/";"https://www.youtube.com/user/SmashGyms";"https://youtu.be/n6xbhuBwKdc";;0;186;

He gets down on the mats at their level and shows them first hand how to do the techniques. His commanding presence helps even the most ""easily distracted' child learn to pay attention, be respectful and help their teammates. Our Academy offers several levels of classes for kids as young as 3 years old, through teens, beginners to competition level classes. The current students, especially the older, more experienced students, are taught how to ""roll"" with new kids, and will quickly help them adjust to the full contact sport. In a matter of weeks your child will feel like part of a big family. Many of our students have been with us since we opened doors, and now compete at the international level for our fight team. Classes begin with a line-up, by rank, from senior belts to newest. We bow to show our respect to our Professor and coaches, and then we warm-up together. Next, Professor demonstrates the techniques we will be learning and pairs the kids up with similar size partners to do practice drills. After water break we come back to do more practice with resistance from our partners, and finally move on to ""real sparring"" under the watchful eye of professor and his adult, high ranking coaches. The classes then have a little fun, playing dodge ball or other cardio working or agility based ""games"" and end with a final line up and hand shake to all the coaches, professor and each other. We have a bleacher type area for parents to watch the training, with free wifi and a TV lobby area with chairs and a mat for littler siblings. But be warned, after you watch your kids train for a few weeks, you may just get the bug to train yourself! Many of our kids have parents that are now training with us.

Here are some interesting facts about International Institute of Martial Arts: Our members are from all walks of life - we have students, attorneys, doctors, engineers, military and law enforcement all training in a fun, team-oriented family environment. We have kids that have been training for years that leave to top colleges and universities in the country, thanks in part to the discipline and focus on hard work they learned through martial arts. This is something we take a great amount of pride in. There are always new generations of individuals and families coming in to pursue the ongoing legacy. It is a tradition in martial arts to pass down the knowledge one receives in their training and many students become instructors, often ending up owning their own schools. It is our goal to inspire strength, discipline, confidence and focus in our students, to help them discover their inner leader. I believe every child has the potential to be a leader, they just need someone to believe in them. As a parent myself, I understand the challenges of raising a confident and focused child in an age where there are more distractions than ever.

In 1978, Rorion Gracie brought Gracie Jiu-Jitsu to the United States, and in 1989 he established the first Gracie Academy on North American soil in Torrance, California. To accommodate the worldwide expansion of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, in 2017, the Gracie Academy moved to a larger facility and was rebranded as “Gracie University” to reflect the shift from a single academy to a global organization. Not only is our Torrance location one of the most successful martial arts schools in the world, with over 1,000 students, but it also serves as the global headquarters for hundreds of Certified Training Centers and over 150,000 home-study students learning online in 196 countries.

In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill your with child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 12. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof program is for you! Even if your child has previously tried Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and had a negative experience, we can assure you that they will absolutely love the Gracie Bullyproof program!";"https://www.gracieuniversity.com/pages/public/information?ip=103";"Women Empowered is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 10-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 15 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to pink belt! Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the perfect self-defense system for women, but only if it is taught correctly. If you’re unsure about learning BJJ for fear of injury, embarrassment, or any other reason, then the Women Empowered program is perfect for you!

Some Historians say that Jiu-Jitsu is the oldest form of martial art having originated in India more than 2,000 years before Christ. It was originally thought to have been developed by Buddhist Monks. Concerned with self-defense, these monks created techniques based upon principles of balance and leverage, and a system of manipulating the body in a manner where one could avoid relying upon strength or weapons. With the expansion of Buddhism, Jiu-Jitsu spread from Southeast Asia to China, finally arriving in Japan where it developed and gained further popularity. However, with the passing of the Tokugawa era (ca. 1800), Japan became somewhat united and there were many changes in Japanese society. One of the results of these changes was the reduction of the Samurai warrior to the status of the common citizen.

Some Historians say that Jiu-Jitsu is the oldest form of martial art having originated in India more than 2,000 years before Christ. It was originally thought to have been developed by Buddhist Monks. Concerned with self-defense, these monks created techniques based upon principles of balance and leverage, and a system of manipulating the body in a manner where one could avoid relying upon strength or weapons.";"https://cdn-cms.f-static.com/uploads/1394942/400_5b79cc88594b6.png";"https://www.graciejiujitsuredwoodcity.com/kids";"Charles Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy offers classes for children ages 4 to 9 and incorporates strength and conditioning to promote body awareness and physical wellness.

Practicing it relieves stress and anxiety while improving health through a vigourous aerobic and anerobic exercise. A Great improvement in cardiovascular performance and breathing is also noticed,even within a practitioner’s first few months. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art in which its students become flexible even without the practices of stretching exercises. This leads to its practitioners becoming more aware and helps them improve memory and hand-eye coordination. Furthermore, because practitioners spar on a daily basis, Jiu-Jitsu provides them with a great oppurtunity to lose weight, increase muscle mass and gain the ability to defend themselves. As a result, Jiu-Jitsu provides its practitioners with an outlet for aggresion and gives shy people confidence and self-esteem.";"http://graciefighter.com/graciefighter/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gracie-fighter.png";"http://graciefighter.com/locations/gracie-sports-center-pleasant-hill-ca/";"Kids Class: Ages 5-14.

Checkmat men, women, and youth have won some of the most prestigious tournaments in the sport including the World Championships, the Brazilian National Championships, and the Abu Dhabi Combat Club (ADCC) Submission Wrestling World Championships. Checkmat’s success comes from the steady leadership and instruction of Master Leo Vieira, a 5th degree BJJ black belt and Judo black belt. Nicknamed “Leozinho” or “Little Lion” he is known—uniquely—as both one of the finest jiu-jitsu competitors of his generation (2X World Champion, 2X ADCC winner) and also as a pioneering coach and instructor. Master Leo sees both the art and science within BJJ, emphasizing technical prowess and invention while also strongly believing in the dynamic expression and individuality of each practitioner. In any given month, you can find Master Leo teaching a world champion, a Sheikh, a prince, a police officer, a nurse, a college student, an elementary school student, or a beginner on her or his first day all with the same kindness, interest, and passion. Why? Because Checkmat is about more than winning trophies and medals, it is focused on inspiring a healthy and positive individual who goes on to create a healthy and positive community. Together, we are stronger. Together, we are better. Together, we are Checkmat.";"https://www.checkmatbjj.com/img/logo.png";"https://www.checkmatbjj.com/img/logo.png";;;;;;"https://www.checkmatbjj.com/schedule";;"Leonardo (Leo) Vieira";;;"https://www.facebook.com/checkmathq/";;;;0;;

We have kids that have been training for years that leave to top colleges and universities in the country, thanks in part to the discipline and focus on hard work they learned through martial arts.

It is our goal to inspire strength, discipline, confidence and focus in our students, to help them discover their inner leader.

Originally, due to its linear nature, the curriculum could only be taught in private lessons. But, after 15 years of experimenting with different training programs, the Gracie Academy developed a curriculum that would enable students to learn all the techniques in a group class setting and still get results that are comparable to those of private classes. Aside from the unparalleled structure and organization of the curriculum, what makes the Gracie Academy group class training programs unique is the way in which we present the techniques. Perfected over three generations, the teaching methodology used at all Certified Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Training Centers allows students to learn at their own pace without feeling overwhelmed or left behind. Furthermore, we conduct all group classes with the utmost concern for safety, and we demand that all students treat each other respectfully regardless of skill level, gender, race, nationality, or creed.

In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill your with child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 13. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof program is for you! Even if your child has previously tried Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and had a negative experience, we can assure you that they will absolutely love the Gracie Bullyproof program!";"http://gjjpd.com/womenempowered/";"Women Empowered is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 10-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 15 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to pink belt! Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the perfect self-defense system for women, but only if it is taught correctly.

Fear of punishment, from school administrators and from parents, is so strong, that most children will do nothing in response to persistent verbal or physical harassment from a bully. By teaching your child the Rules of Engagement, not only will you ensure that they do not abuse their power, but you will give them a step-by-step plan to follow any time they are targeted by a bully and the assurance that you will support them in the event that they are compelled to stand up for themselves.

"Ralph Gracie Sacramento";"http://www.ralphgraciesac.com/";(916) 692-8814;"4000 Truxel Rd #1";"Sacramento";"CA";95834;;"United States";"Jiu-Jitsu originated in India more than 4000 years ago. It was created by monks who could not use weapons to defend their lives against barbarian attacks. It spread through China, and eventually took root and was built upon in Japan becoming the first martial art style. Samurai clans in Japan adopted Jiu-Jitsu as their own traditional style to defeat an opponent via striking, throwing and/or grappling. With the passing years, they split the techniques and developed other martial arts styles, such as Judo, Aikido and Karate. In 1914, Japanese Jiu-Jitsu champion Esai Maeda migrated to Brazil, where he was instrumental in establishing a Japanese immigrant community. His efforts were aided by Gastão Gracie, a Brazilian scholar and politician of Scottish descent. As an expression of his gratitude for Gracie’s assistance, Maeda taught the Brazilian’s oldest son Carlos the essential secrets of Jiu-Jitsu. Carlos taught Maeda’s techniques to his four brothers, and in 1925 they opened the first Gracie Jiu-Jitsu academy in Brazil. For the Gracie brothers, teaching the art was more than an occupation, it was their passion. One of the brothers, Helio Gracie, paid special interest to the use of these techniques. Being of small frame, light in weight (only 135 pounds), and in frail health, Helio was 16 when he began learning Jiu-Jitsu. Unable to participate in classes, he would sit and watch his older brother teach every day. One day when Carlos was unable to make it to class, Helio was asked to instruct. Because of his size and stature, he began to work with and adapt the basic rules of Jiu-Jitsu. He introduced the application of leverage to the art, making it possible for a smaller opponent to defeat a larger one. He began experimenting, modifying and enhancing the basic techniques to make them effective for a person regardless of his or her stature. Thus began the development of a new and more effective art – Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Gracie’s brother Helio’s skills eventually enabled him to beat some of the world’s greatest fighters. His feats include the longest fight in recorded history – 3 hours and 45 minutes, non-stop – and the historic match against Masahiko Kimura, who was arguably the greatest fighter in Japan. Helio Gracie taught well into his 90's and is widely recognized as a martial arts and grappling legend. Helio’s quest became today’s Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, a martial art that is continuously evolving as a result of input from practitioners throughout the world.";;;;;;;;"http://www.ralphgraciesac.com/#block-views-front-parallax-solutions-block";;"Manny Gonzales";"Free Week";;"https://www.facebook.com/ralphgraciesacramento/";;;;1;;

Because of its effectiveness, BJJ has been the cornerstone of mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions. BJJ's emphasis on technique and leverage allows anyone to participate and excel in the art, regardless of age, gender, or physical ability. If you're looking for a challenging and fun way to attain optimal physical condition, try this technical martial art in a safe, friendly, and ego-free environment. Both adult and kids' classes are taught by Derek DiManno, a BJJ black belt, with over 25 years of combined experience in BJJ, Judo, and wrestling. Derek is the first American-born black belt under 2003 World Jiu Jitsu Champion, Cassio Werneck, and the third BJJ black belt in the Sacramento metropolitan area.

How often have you seen your children wrestling on the floor of your living room? Brazilian Jiu Jitsu provides a great way to channel that energy into something productive and rewarding. Classes at Waza BJJ combine the basics of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with fun and exciting skill-oriented exercises and games to improve their gross motor skills, coordination, strength, flexibility, and agility. Besides these physical benefits and self defense skills, kids in the Waza BJJ program receive the following social benefits: Character development; Better focusing and listening skills; Sportsmanship; Goal setting; Self-discipline/self-control; Improved social and interpersonal skills; Greater respect for adults and peers; Greater confidence and self-esteem (especially in children that are shy or have been bullied in school); and Conflict/peer pressure management (we teach our kids to be assertive, but not aggressive). Ultimately, we try to ensure that the kids in our program are happier and healthier and have the qualities and skills that will help them throughout their entire lives.";;;;;"http://www.wazabjj.com/WazaBJJ_Schedule.pdf";;"Derek DiManno";;"wazabjj@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/Waza-Brazilian-Jiu-Jitsu-108019409223259/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8idcBqmbAsyGcbMx8N_xqA";"https://youtu.be/VZ35H69eBeg";;1;;
