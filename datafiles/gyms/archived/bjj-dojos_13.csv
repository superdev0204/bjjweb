Vandry was one of Texas’ first four BJJ Black belts under Machado; and has competed for 7 years at the world Championship Pan Americano.

You better believe it! Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a popular martial art that blends science, philosophy and physical application toward self defense. Kids learn motor and reactive skills at an early age under quality BJJ instruction. Many times in our society, martial arts are misperceived as simply a ritual of greetings – bowing to attribute respect and attending class as a means towards rank; but this is simply not so at our Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school. At the Vandry BJJ Academy in Austin, there are Brazilian Jiu Jitsu children’s classes for the ages of 7-15. The kids BJJ class initiates learning physical training to develop a child’s stamina and strength. The children learn techniques of BJJ for the purposes of self-defense, future sport competition; and to develop motor skills via more hands on athletic training through monitored Brazilian Jiu Jitsu sparring. Head Instructor William Vandry, Coach Dr. Jeff Snow, Coach Myron Dixon and Coach John Hancock teach the kid’s class. BJJ has no room for egos, the style eliminates ego very quickly. Our academy nurtures and establishes bonds of communication along with the athletic “team” approach for children. Martial arts has used the pitch of the “bully” sale for decades; in which guaranteeing children’s ability to overcome a bully is sold as long as the parent’s pay dues. At Vandry BJJ, there is more to our approach, corrections, new techniques, constant mat time, sparring with different bodies and speeds that make a difference in children. This enables your child to face approaches of a confrontational situation in life. Team Vandry has numerous children successful in BJJ tournaments, whom demonstrate their skills learned at the Austin academy. Whether your child competes or not, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu helps solve some important learning lessons for children.";"http://austinbjj.com/classes/women/";"Women are a smaller percentage of active Martial artists than men.

Just before he was about to test for his black belt, he stumbled upon Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and began secretly attending classes while he was still training Karate. In his competitions in Karate, Joao won 5 State Tournaments and was 2nd place in a National Tournament in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. However, once Joao had a taste of BJJ he no longer had the desire to complete his black belt in Karate, and began training BJJ full time in 1998. Before he came to the United States, he earned his blue belt under Leonardo Castello Branco in Rio. In addition to his martial arts training, Joao was a strong competitor in Wind Surfing and Sailing in Brazil. He won the amateur circuit 3 times in the Caribbean competitions. Joao was a part of the sports and nutrition world as a top sales representative for Optimum Nutrition and started his own store in 1999. During this time, he developed a friendship with world renowned Carlson Gracie. Carlson would visit his store regularly, just to visit and talk about life. Years later when Joao began training in jiu-jitsu again, he became an instructor under Carlson Gracie. Joao has been teaching Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in the Austin area for two decades, and has operated his own school in Dripping Springs for ten years. A few years ago he expanded to Austin, and now owns and operates two jiu-jitsu schools in the Austin area. Joao is considered to be an expert in teaching children jiu-jitsu, and many of the top Brazilian jiu-jitsu coaches and school owners have turned to him for advice on starting their own children’s programs. He has created numerous DVDs and video resources for instructors on teaching Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and has schools affiliated with him across the country and overseas. Joao speaks four languages, and has also traveled throughout Europe teaching seminars and spreading the art of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. He currently resides in Austin, TX, and when he’s not teaching BJJ he enjoys outdoor activities such as rock climbing, hiking, and swimming.";;"https://joaocrusbjj.com/children-program-form/";"Kids today face a lot of challenges, and certainly one of them is getting enough physical activity to be fit and healthy. However, at Joao Crus Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, we offer more than just an exercise program or sport for your child. And, we also offer a great deal more than just a fun after-school activity for kids. Sure, your kid is going to leave each class sweating and smiling – that’s a given. But what we strive for here at Joao Crus BJJ is to teach kids crucial skills they need for success in school and life. Skills that they just aren’t getting at school or on the playground these days, and that they surely aren’t developing through interacting with digital media.";;;;;;;"Joao Crus";"Free uniform with 30 days classes for $99";;"https://www.facebook.com/joaocrusbjjatx/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLBZ8MYNkWf5_EJTuIYLCdQ";"https://youtu.be/mvG34QZBHLs";;1;1258;

The Gracie Barra Future Champions Program was created to provide children ages 3-15 with an environment that allows them to experience and understand core values like focus, discipline, persistence, cooperation and respect. As a contact sport, Gracie Barra Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provides a very challenging yet safe and caring environment for a child to mature towards a real life champion.The outcome of continued childhood practice of GB BJJ goes far beyond the accomplishments on the mats. The discipline and excellence demanded by our instructors often carries over to the child’s behavior at home and at school. Our Future Champions Program is typically subdivided in three different groups to accommodate students of different ages and skill levels: Little Champions I (3-6 years old), Little Champions II (7-9 Years Old), Juniors & Teens (10-14 years old).";"http://www.graciebarracorpuschristi.com/programs/women/";"Aside from all classes offered in the Adults Gracie Barra Program Structure, our school offers a set of classes designed to introduce women to the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. As a martial art designed to allow the weaker to defeat the stronger, BJJ is a perfect fit for women who are interested in learning how to protect themselves – and who wouldn’t be, right? The Gracie Barra Women’s Program combines a comprehensive self-defense curriculum with emphasis on drills that simulate realistic attack and escape situations. The techniques are complemented by a strong fitness component that is second to none compared to classes offered in regular gyms. Classes specially designed for women like Rape Prevention, BJJ Conditioning and social “get togethers” are added benefits to the ordinary GB activities and create a strong bond between the members of the “Gracie Barra Pink Team.”";;;"http://www.graciebarracorpuschristi.com/schedule/";;"Leo Cantu";"Free Class";"cantubjj1973@yahoo.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GracieBarraCorpusChristiBrazilianJiuJitsu";"https://www.youtube.com/user/gbcorpuschristibjj";"https://youtu.be/gtmDagCf63A";;1;1299;

Furthermore, that very fear of bullying leads to low self-esteem and depression in children and adolescents alike. Making matters worse is the fact that bullying goes virtually unaccounted for, with less than 15% of children actually reporting the abuse. Bullies rely on fear tactics, coercion and intimidation to gain power. They assert dominance over their victims through repeated acts of aggressive behavior, inflicting both physical and mental harm. Though it is common knowledge that the only way to defeat bullies is to stand up to them, most children feel incapable of confronting their tormentors because of an overwhelming concern for their personal safety. At RPBJJ, we instill the confidence necessary for a target of bullying to face his/her aggressor, thus neutralizing the situation and restoring the balance of power. Our approach is simple and straight forward. We equip our students with the tools necessary to defend themselves against physical attack, which, in turn, revitalizes confidence, leading to a healthy physical and mental state of being. While most martial arts programs rely on striking the attacker with violent punches, kicks, knees, and elbows, our Bully Proof Kid’s Program utilizes the unique and highly effective approach of using purely defensive techniques. The focus of our curriculum is self-defense with no striking necessary for success. In addition, our students are taught how to defuse confrontations with words and never to initiate physical aggression. If attacked, our students are prepared to defend themselves with techniques that non-violently neutralize the threat and allow them to gain control of their opponent. At RPBJJ, we operate under the belief that the most effectual way to fight fire is with water. THE BULLY PROOF PROGRAM HAS FOUR KEY OBJECTIVES: Instill Confidence: Bullies are far less likely to target self-confident children. We promote confidence in our students through the use of effective self-defense techniques, based on principles of leverage. These techniques give our children the ability to neutralize the attack of a larger opponent. Increase Awareness: Abuse from bullies ranges from verbal insults to physical aggression, and can be dispensed at various intensity levels. In each class, we focus on teaching your child to recognize and respond to customary bully behaviors. Ensure Readiness: Your child can only find freedom from the persecution of a bully, once he/she makes it perfectly clear that the harassment will no longer be tolerated. We prepare our students for every common contingency. Character Development: In addition to providing instruction on how to deal with the complications and challenges of bullying, our Kid’s Bully Proof Program develops the essential character traits that will lead to your child’s success in all areas of life. The principles and philosophy of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu transcend the dojo and encompass every aspect of our daily lives. We dedicate time in each class to address fundamental values like respect, loyalty, discipline, family and honor, encouraging and inspiring each child to make character changes in their daily lives – on their own!";;;"MMA";;"http://rodrigopinheirobjj.com/classes/program-schedule/";;"Rodrigo Pinheiro";;;"https://www.facebook.com/RPBJJ/";;;;1;1316;

Furthermore, that very fear of bullying leads to low self-esteem and depression in children and adolescents alike. Making matters worse is the fact that bullying goes virtually unaccounted for, with less than 15% of children actually reporting the abuse. Bullies rely on fear tactics, coercion and intimidation to gain power. They assert dominance over their victims through repeated acts of aggressive behavior, inflicting both physical and mental harm. Though it is common knowledge that the only way to defeat bullies is to stand up to them, most children feel incapable of confronting their tormentors because of an overwhelming concern for their personal safety. At RPBJJ, we instill the confidence necessary for a target of bullying to face his/her aggressor, thus neutralizing the situation and restoring the balance of power. Our approach is simple and straight forward. We equip our students with the tools necessary to defend themselves against physical attack, which, in turn, revitalizes confidence, leading to a healthy physical and mental state of being. While most martial arts programs rely on striking the attacker with violent punches, kicks, knees, and elbows, our Bully Proof Kid’s Program utilizes the unique and highly effective approach of using purely defensive techniques.

"LX Jiu-Jitsu & Self Defense";"https://lxbjj.com/";(888) 592-5501;"3322 Hwy 6";"Sugar Land";"TX";77479;;"United States";"LX Jiu-Jitsu has one goal in mind, to offer a dedicated facility aimed at providing access to world-class self-defense instruction. In order to achieve this, it is imperative that we provide a superior training environment free from ego, attitude, and intimidation. As such, the facility has been designed to create a warm, inviting environment for both participating students as well as spectators to feel completely at ease while they enjoy their class. For regularly scheduled and/or semi-private lessons we have our large training mat which offers a 2000 square foot training area; a secondary training mat is located next to the changing rooms and is reserved for one-on-one training and introductory lessons. For spectators, there is a seating area in the very front of the academy with large viewing panes to watch the activities on the mat; relax in one of our chairs or perhaps enjoy a coconut water on our couches while you observe the class. As hydration is important for everyone, not just participants, we have water fountains on site as well as several healthy alternative drinks for purchase from our vending machine. Since jiu-jitsu is also a contact-based art, considerations are also given to cleanliness with separate restrooms, a private changing area, and multiple sanitizing stations to help visitors feel more at ease. In addition, the mats are specifically designed for this activity so special precautions are taken in selecting manufacturing materials that are known to repel water, are hygienic, antimicrobial, and odor absorption. Care is also taken here at the school to sterilize the mat surface on a daily basis with hospital-grade disinfectant; this serves as another precautionary measure in providing you with piece of mind while training. Accordingly, it is important that all participants have a clean kimono for each training session. For those who are joining us on the mat, your safety is our utmost concern which is why LX Jiu-Jitsu only utilizes the absolute best mats available. As mentioned above these mats are specifically designed for purpose so that any impact with the mat is reduced and absorbed as much as possible. Utilizing inferior training equipment is an easy way to sustain injuries; we want you to be a lifelong student of the art and this becomes much harder if you are constantly injured. Let us be clear that jiu-jitsu is an athletic activity and there are certain risks involved, but by providing this safe, ego-free environment at our facility we are glad to say that these risks are reduced as much as humanly possible. That said, injury can also result from the use of improper technique, which again is why Professor Xavier stresses the details of every single technique in both class instructionals as well as when he observes live training. This is for the safety of not only you and your training partner but also your teammates who may be sharing the mat with you. As your understanding of the basics begins to take shape, your effectiveness and efficiency in applying techniques will improve. It is with this understanding that your journey begins.";"https://lxbjj.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logo-name2r-2018.png";"https://lxbjj.com/programs/youth-programs/";"National studies have shown that nearly 30% of children have experienced some form of bullying in school. Our Little Wizards Bully Proof program teaches children how to defend themselves in these situations through non-violent conflict resolution. They are taught to use Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, a self-defense system that uses leverage to submit an aggressor, without the need to throw a single punch or kick. Your child will not be taught how to strike another person but they will learn how to react and defend themselves in a safe and effective manner that minimizes their risk of injury or harm. This process of learning to defend themselves empowers your child to develop leadership skills such as self-confidence, courage, responsibility and discipline. The program is also great way to promote an active and healthy lifestyle for kids of any age, shape and size. Our students gain self-esteem through athletic achievement and learn how to carry themselves better in situations that require them to deal with pressure. The Little Wizards Bully Proof program students represent the future of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and their development is extremely important to Professor Xavier, who began his career as a world-class instructor by helping oversee the youth program at Gracie Humaita in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. Because of this experience all of our instructors and students are committed to helping the youngest members of our team develop into healthy and respectful people that apply what they learn at the LX Jiu-Jitsu academy to succeed in all facets of their lives. Our instructors are dedicated to providing your child with a nurturing environment in which they will learn the art of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and its many benefits. Professor Xavier has taken extra special consideration in designing a student-centered curriculum that seamlessly integrates conditioning and self-defense techniques into a well-rounded physical and mental education program. Our youth program takes into consideration input from Texas certified public education teachers so that our student’s individual needs are met by incorporating activities for visual, auditory and kinesthetic learners alike. The Little Wizards Bully Proof program can be taught in a group format during our youth classes or individually through our private lessons program. The Little Wizards Bully Proof program group classes are organized into 3 age groups to ensure the most effective learning environment for your child: Little Wizards I (4-7 years old), Little Wizards II (8-11 years old), Junior Wizards (12-15 years old).";"https://lxbjj.com/programs/womens-program/";"Our women’s self-defense program is designed to maximize the effectiveness of Gracie Jiu-jitsu techniques while taking into consideration the capabilities of the female body. This program is designed to empower women by increasing the awareness of their surroundings and enabling them to react calmly and effectively in order to defend themselves in adverse situations like confronting a robber or, in worst-case scenarios, fending off a potential sexual assault. Using the principles of leverage, timing, positioning and momentum will allow women, regardless of their build, to neutralize size differences, whether standing or on the ground, when defending themselves from any attacker. The women’s self-defense program also serves as a very effective aerobic and anaerobic exercise that through consistent attendance will result in weight loss, improved cardiovascular conditioning, flexibility, increased strength and muscle tone and an overall sense of healthiness and well-being.";;;"https://lxbjj.com/class-schedule/";;"Leonardo Xavier";;"contact@leonardoxavier.com";"https://www.facebook.com/LXJiuJitsu";"https://www.youtube.com/user/LXBJJ";"https://youtu.be/MrUVGM90WxU";;1;1343;

In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill your child with unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 12. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof program is for you!

We have a cage, heavy bags and the best mats on the market available for our students. Gracie Barra schools are well known worldwide for their commitment to teaching high-level Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. At our school, you will receive hands-on attention from our world class professors and instructors who will monitor your progress in a clean, safe, and family-friendly environment. Our professors and instructors are trained under the Gracie Barra Curriculum created by Master Carlos Gracie Jr. and are also IBJJF (International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation) certified. The instructors are also certified by the Gracie Barra Association and have years of experience in teaching, competing and studying the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Our school is for anyone and everyone who is looking to get in shape, learn self-defense, and improve the overall quality of their lives. In addition, our family-oriented environment is a perfect place to teach your children how to feel safe everyday when they are at school or outside playing. It also aids in developing their self-confidence and discipline. A typical Gracie Barra student starts with an introductory class where he or she will learn the overall self-defense strategy of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and afterwards enroll in the Gracie Barra Fundamentals Program. After four months of training and learning all the techniques that encompass the Fundamental’s curriculum, the student will be recommended to join the Gracie Barra Advanced Program. With eight months of training and experience, the student will have the maturity level and enough knowledge to enroll in the Gracie Barra Black Belt Program. It is in the Gracie Barra Black Belt Program where he or she will be exposed to all kinds of training dynamics including Mixed Martial Arts, MMA, BJJ No-Gi and high level BJJ-Gi. This helps the student develop his or her own Jiu-Jitsu game, strategy and technique(s). Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a beautiful art and everyone is capable of learning it and enjoying its many benefits. Gracie Barra programs reflect more than thirty years of Master Carlos Gracie’s teaching experience and have succeeded in improving the life quality, self-esteem, discipline and health of thousands of individuals around the world in addition to building some of the best BJJ fighters ever known.

Instruction – the coach will demonstrate a move and will break it down, step-by-step for the students.   The coach will continue to demonstrate different variations of that move and will proceed depending on the skill level of the class. It is very important for students to pay close attention during this time to get the most out of the technique. If a student has problems grasping the techniques, our coaches will be quick to assist. Drills—the students will pair up and drill each move between 4-6 minutes until the student feels comfortable. Drilling is an imperative part of our program in order for the student to become accustomed to the different positions and movements of jiu-jitsu. Rolling/grappling—after the instruction and drills, the student will apply the techniques that they have learned during a rolling/grappling session with each other.

Luckily, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is designed so the smaller, more technical person can defeat the larger attacker. As with anything, the only way to get proficient in self defense is practice, practice, practice. What you may not know is that BJJ and Self Defense are synonymous! If you train BJJ long enough, it becomes second nature and it’s much more likely to be there when you need it. Aside from that, women and men alike tend to grow strong bonds with the people they train along side. The feeling of “family” is something heard quite often at Insight BJJ. Also, (along with a cleaner diet) most people who are looking to lose weight, do so through training BJJ. Those who continue to train BJJ tend to keep the weight off for longer. Being lead by multiple time IBJJF gold medallist, Coach Rebekah, this class will focus on mostly fundamentals in the beginning, and will be open only to women and teen girls.

They will learn how to stay out of range of punches until they are ready to close the distance and force the fight to the ground, where they will be skilled at controlling their opponent. We strive to not only give your child the skills they need to defend themselves but also to teach them to be humble, respectful and courteous at all times. In our Advanced Jiu-Jitsu classes your child will build on the fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Judo and they will learn the basics of submissions and submission escapes. They will also be exposed to an intense conditioning program. The “fighting” that children do in our program is actually great preparation for life’s many challenges. Competing, whether it is with fellow class mates or in tournaments, teaches our students persistence, resolve and perseverance. As in life, we do not always win. Our students learn that winning is not nearly as important as dedicating themselves to achieving a goal and finding the courage to compete.";;;"Judo, Tae Kwon Do, Kendo, MMA";;"https://www.magnoliabjj.com/schedule.html";;"Scott Caldwell";;"magnoliabjj@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/magnoliabjj";;;;1;;

The benefits from training, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in particular, are endless. Here are 7 reasons to get your child started in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. 1 – Confidence - Martial arts develops confidence in children, but Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu does it best! BJJ is very different than traditional martial arts. There are no choreographed patterns, screaming and breaking boards, and there is no punching and kicking. BJJ allows kids to engage in a realistic combat situation where they are trying to grapple to a dominant position, escape a compromising position or apply a submission (joint lock or choke). BJJ gives a child real self confidence and a real way to defend themselves. 2 – Social Skills - The environment on the mat is incredible. When we walk into the academy we are all equal, no matter what. BJJ brings in people from all walks of life and kids can meet new friends they may never have in any other way. We see each other all the time, creating a very strong bond. We trust and depend on each other in order to learn. 3 – Fitness - BJJ will develop functional strength, cardiovascular endurance and flexibility. You are always learning new techniques and the ability to “tap out” allows you to train at 100% without risk of serious injury. Plus, it’s more fun to work out with your friends! 4 – Focus - BJJ provides an activity that is both physically demanding and mentally stimulating. Learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is fun but it can be challenging. If it’s fun and challenging, they’ll want to do it. 5 – Problem Solving Skills - BJJ enables children to develop vital problem solving skills. Every class and training partner provides new problems and situations that must be overcome. They will learn to solve problems in a timely manner while under pressure. 6 – Self-Defense - Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a great self-defense system to learn. It has been shown that most physical altercations end up on the ground where Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is most useful. But also, BJJ teaches you to be a calm person and you become better at avoiding and preventing such altercations. 7 – Superhero Dreams - It’s not very likely that we will ever be bitten by a radioactive spider to superpower our bodies. Everyone wants to improve upon themselves. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu will bring kids closer to their superhero dreams than anything else. They will learn more life lessons on the mat than in any ivy league school.";;;;;"https://sharpenironacademy.com/schedule-plano";;"Alex Faria";;"PlanoTX@SharpenIron.com";"https://www.facebook.com/SharpenIronAcademyPlano/";"https://www.youtube.com/user/graciegymplano";;;0;;

An unfair system, but one that our children have to live with. Our gym offers an Anti-Bullying program that will allow the kids to learn to defend themselves, within the limits allowed by the state, and therefore avoid trouble. Instead, of punching, the kids learn to take down bullies and how to hold them down without either child being hurt.";"https://www.316bjj.com/women-s-self-defense";"It is a sad fact that one in four women will be a victim of abuse in America today and even in our relatively small communities of Rockwall, Royse city, Greenville, Caddo Mills, Wylie, Lavon, Rowlett, Heath and surrounding cities and counties in Texas. We here at 316 Gracie style  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu feel obligated to give back to our Texas communities in Rockwall and Hunt Counties by helping arm our women with the ability to protect themselves which is why we are so passionate about women's self defense. Our training combines basic self-defense with a desire to see women grow in their confidence to defend themselves. We offer specialized female only events periodically that will instruct women how to defend themselves against various types of attacks and various types of weapons, even if they are completely unarmed. However, we encourage women to attend our regular classes in order to gain the most knowledge and proficiency in self defense with the use of Gracie style Brazilian Jiu Jitsu martial arts. As with most things, practice makes perfect. The more often a technique is drilled the more likely one will be able to successfully use in in a real life situation. Our classes will also offer the opportunity to use your skill against men, increasing confidence in the effectiveness of the skill. Training is an intense full body workout which has beneficial side effects like weight loss, toning, muscle gain and most importantly self confidence! We have seen women who had so much anxiety it was hard for them to function daily overcome the anxiety and fear to live much happier and fuller lives! It is no magic pill by any stretch of the imagination,  Gracie style Brazilian Jiu Jitsu  takes hard work, hours on the mat and dedication but with all of this can truly transform lives. It uses all the muscles and requires a large amount of cardio—compressing hours of time at the gym with hundreds of machines—into a single hour. With consistent training the health benefits become just as important as self-defense. One increases flexibility, cardio conditioning, muscle strength, core strength, and gains a vast knowledge of self-defense.";;;"https://www.316bjj.com/class-schedule";"Mon, Tues, Thurs: 12:00pm-8:30pm; Wed: 5:45-8:45pm; Fri: 12:00pm-1:00pm; Sat: 9:00am-12:30pm";"Eduardo 'Gaviao' Ommati";;"316bjj@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/316BJJ/";;;;1;;

In 1882, Ryu, the multiple schools of Japanese Jiu-Jitsu were combined to create the Japanese art of Kodokan Judo. From this art, Jiu-Jitsu was born. Jiu-Jitsu promotes the principle that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend them selves against a bigger, stronger assailant using leverage and proper techniques; most notably, by applying joint locks and chokeholds to defeat them. Contenders train in Jiu-Jitsu to prepare for Gi (Sport Grappling) Tournaments, No-Gi (Submission Wrestling) and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) Competition or Self-Defense. Sparring, commonly referred to as rolling, and live drilling play a major role in training. A premium is placed on performance, especially in competition.";"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54e66ef4e4b0b080e14fbf57/1565195955971-1D96SGM1TMAESPQIP78O/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDVEj010BbXsLnm509AHjVF7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1URgcHTpqDAQtV2R6KdC7zZbaM3y30Ca-3Xje4x1IhSpbm7cT0R_dexc_UL_zbpz6JQ/nelsonfont1.png?format=300w";"http://www.shebarojj.com/classes";"Shebaro Jiu Jitsu Young Athletes is a program for younger athletes ages 5-13 that mixes fitness, martial arts and discipline. We help to give your child the tools to cope with stressful situations while maintaining a calm outlook. Combining fitness with martial arts ensures that not only will your child be healthier and happier but they will be more confident as well. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is unique among todays martial arts in that it is able to teach young athletes a way of defending themselves while allowing them to choose the level of force. This means that even in the event of a conflict, the maximum safety is maintained. This type of training helps to produce a much higher level of confidence than most other systems.

Through the principles of Jiu-Jitsu, the kids learn that Commitment, Respect, Focus, Self-Discipline, Hard Work and Effort always make for a rewarding experience and bring positive results. What we care about the most with our kids is how they conduct themselves in and out of the gym and most importantly, their integrity. We put a premium on ensuring our kids are treating themselves and those around them with the utmost respect. We do everything in our power to ensure that our kids are being a positive influence on their peers and the community.

Reduce Stress. You can kick and punch your way to a stress-free zone within minutes of your high-energy kickboxing routine. The movements in kickboxing challenge several core muscle groups and will give you a total body workout, fast. 2. Boost Confidence Levels. According to Dr. Rose Windale of Healthzine.org, kickboxing helps you release endorphins which will give your mood a boost and help you feel more confident. Endorphins will also make you feel happier and more positive for several hours after the workout. 3. Improved Coordination. If you’re suffering from posture problems and have poor coordination, you can strengthen your ‘core’ and improve your reflexes and coordination skills. The speedy punches and kicks in the kickboxing routine will give you a chance to focus your energy to execute each movement successfully. 4. Burn Mega Calories. Muscle and Fitness Magazine reports that fitness kickboxing can burn over 800 calories per hour, and you’ll be toning up your entire body as you rev up your metabolism. It’s a high-power cardio routine that’s great for weight loss and getting you in shape, fast. 5. Ideal Cross-Training Workout. If you’ve been pounding on the treadmill for several weeks and need a break from your usual cardio routine, kickboxing is the perfect cross-training workout. You can add some weights by wearing wrist weights or ankle weights, or just putting on a pair of lightweight boxing gloves for extra resistance. Just one or two routines a week can help you break out of a fitness rut, fast. 6. Energy Boost. Kickboxing is a high-energy cardio routine that will give your body and mind a boost, and will increase your energy levels. You’ll be breathing hard and sweating out toxins; this process will give your energy levels a much-needed boost. 7. Better Posture. If you’re hunched over a computer all day, kickboxing workouts will challenge many muscle groups that don’t get enough attention throughout the day, and you’ll start to build up your core. Core muscles in around your abdominal wall are targeted with kickboxing routines because you need to use your waist and abs for balance, and to execute each carefully coordinated move. Kickboxing workouts offer several benefits for your body and mind, and are a great choice for getting out of a fitness rut. Whether you’re a fitness fanatic or just getting started with a workout routine, kickboxing can help you reach your fitness goals.";"Kickboxing, MMA";;"http://www.ionjiujitsuandfitness.com/schedule/";;;"Kids: 30 Day Trial Program!

In the real world almost all fights end up on the ground. The majority of people will then panic and will be at an absolute lost of what to do. Just taking bjj classes regularly will solve that. The more you show the more you will know. BJJ is one of the hardest but most rewarding martial arts when you get a promotion. Nothing is handed out or bought here. We do not charge for any belt or stripe promotion here. It is earned when it is their time. Because it is earned the feeling is one in a million and justified.";;;;"Standard - $125 per month per student. Unlimited Classes. Drop In FEES​: $20 dollar drop in fees for classes.
