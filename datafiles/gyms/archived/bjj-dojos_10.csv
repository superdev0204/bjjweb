Given the fact that controlling an opponent is generally easier on the ground than in a standing position, much of the technique of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu pertains to the skill of taking an opponent down to the ground and grappling for dominant control positions from where the opponent can be submitted or rendered harmless. Utilizing superior leverage, grip, technique and position we can control and overcome even larger/stronger aggressors. Practitioners of the art gain a deep understanding of the workings, strengths, vulnerabilities and limits of the human body. Classes at the academy are taught 7 days a week. They include a strength & endurance building warmup, technical instruction and live rolling. It is among the most demanding and cerebral workouts you will ever experience.

This victorious ascent started with Sensei Ricardo Carvalho’s initiative when he decided to start his own academy because of the large number of students he had. Previously, in 1989, his brother — Sensei Edson Carvalho - had left to fight in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he quickly attained and established great fame. So with intentions to honor his brother Sensei Ricardo Carvalho named the academy after him. At that time, Jiu-Jitsu was being promoted in the state of Bahia in Brazil, although the largest concentration of fighters was in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and the city of Manaus in the state of Amazonas. Sensei Edson Carvalho is a native of Bahia and because he already had a large following and respected name in Rio de Janeiro, he was able to command a greater interest and his fellow citizens' great admiration thus he was the catalyst for the growth of Jiu-Jitsu in Bahia. Competitions were taking place everywhere in Bahia and they were great incentives for fighters who wanted better performances and greater competitiveness; all with a healthy and positive balance. In that context, Senseis Edson and Ricardo Carvalho created “(JJFB) Federacao Baina De Jiu-Jitsu” in 1996.  Their objective was to manage the growth of the sport in Bahia different from other states. After all, they had an extensive historical and strong influence from the discipline of Judo in their backgrounds.  The difference is in the slogan of JJFB: "" Jiu-Jitsu Against Drugs"". A philosophy of discipline and respect among the participants, athletes and leaders is followed not only by JJFB but for all that join Team Carvalho anywhere in the world. Welcome to Team Carvalho! You are family!!! Come in and make yourself at home.";;"http://www.teamcarvalho.com/kids-judo.html";"Lil Lions JUDO (kids judo PROGRAM Ages 4-6) Is your child full of energy? Is your child shy?

Do you want your child prepared mentally and physically for a successful future full of sports participation and physical education? Then our kids Judo program is for you!  Don't worry, these questions are perfectly normal and are asked by parents that worry about their children's well being. In this regard, Team Carvalho serves as an incentive to change bad habits and develop abilities that will help his or her overall growth. The abilities that your son or daughter will acquire with Team Carvalho, will help them develop as human beings and become confident, attentive, disciplined, responsible, respectful of others, better adjusted socially, with good motor and cognitive coordination, more agile, with good reflexes, self-esteem, self-knowledge, and self-control in any situation that life brings them. The importance of the Judo in your child’s development:  Judo is practiced by both sexes and it has contributed greatly with parents and teachers in helping children's development. In some countries such as France and Japan, Judo is such an important sport that it is part of the school curriculum. The child that practices Judo develops muscles gently. Many orthopedic physicians recommend Judo during childhood, because they believe that it’s a good for normal development in this stage of life without compromising growth and physical structures. The practice of a sport is essential to motivate a child all around. It helps children occupy their minds with healthy thoughts and attitudes and it develops the body in a healthy way.

Benefits of ABQKB-MMA's Youth Martial Arts Program: Self-Confidence - For many children, self confidence doesn't come naturally. Confidence is developed over a period of time. As a child accomplishes new goals, his or her confidence level increases. Children become more self-confident in Martial Arts because they progress at their own pace and are not compared to others. Better Grades - Being a Martial Artist also means being a better student. Every child learns to follow directions, pay attention in class and participate in class activities. These skills help them to become better students. Coordination - Martial Arts challenges the entire body, developing coordination, balance, agility and poise. These traits are often neglected and not fully developed in team sports. Discipline - Martial Arts will help your child to discover that through self-discipline and perseverance he or she can accomplish almost anything. Self-Defense - Martial Arts teaches children to think instead of panic in potentially serious situations as well as how to react to threats from other kids. Your child will also be taught not to be a bully. For life threatening situations only, your child will learn practical self-defense.";;;"Focus Fit Boxing, Conditioning, Filipino Martial Arts, Extreme Fitness & Conditioning, Submission Wrestling, Kickboxing, MMA, Muay Thai, Savate, Self Defense, Jun Fan Gung Fu-Kickboxing, Jeet Kune Do";;"http://www.abqkickboxing.com/schedules.html";;"Ray Yee";;"abqkbinfo@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/abqkickboxingmma/";;;;1;1019;

Once famously known as Academy J-sect Jiu Jitsu, founder and MMA pioneer John Lewis, opened the first Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school in the Vegas Valley which became a popular training destination for mixed martial artist across the world. Lewis eventually teamed up with professional boxer and UNLV boxing coach Skipper Kelp to add the striking element to J-sect Jiu Jitsu. Academy J-sect quickly became one of the premier mixed martial arts training centers in the world. As the popularity of the UFC skyrocketed in the early to mid 2000's, J-sect opened its doors to the everyday person and was no longer just a place for fighters and jiu jitsu competitors. Academy J-sect's clientele became much more diversified and different classes were added to the curriculum to accommodate the new customers so that everyone could benefit from the knowledge and skills of Lewis and Kelp. Lewis, a successful entrepreneur and aspiring actor, moved to California to pursue other business opportunities and left sole ownership of the gym to Skipper Kelp. Kelp wanted the name of the gym to reflect what was happening inside, which was Boxing, Muay Thai, Judo, Jiu Jitsu, and MMA. So many fighting disciplines were represented under one roof that the only appropriate name could be the Fight Capital.

Here are several reasons why Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is one of the safest forms for children to begin their journey into the world of martial arts: It is a non-violent, yet effective and complete self-defense system. Many parents want their child to learn a martial art in order to defend herself/himself against bullies or unwanted strangers. Having a safe and systematic foundation of self-defense is key for children to feel confident, specifically about defending themselves, if necessary. Since it is completely based in leverage and submission, BJJ technique actually gives the smaller opponent an advantage. There is no kicking or punching involved, unlike many other martial arts. It is a natural martial art, based on leverage and balance. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu uses the principles of action – reaction, leverage, and base. Children learn to use an opponent’s power as an advantage, rather than fighting against the force. We practice many different games that help children experience these principles and learn to understand how to use them as techniques. Children develop a heightened sense of body awareness and coordination, which leads to self-confidence and inner discipline. Not only do children learn how to effectively defend themselves, but also strengthen their kinesthetic abilities to excel in any other sport of which they participate. It doesn’t have to be a choice of one sport or the other.";"http://www.cobrinhabjjlasvegas.com/programs/womens-self-defense/";"As in most situations, women get blindsided and attacked when they least expect it, where attackers take advantage of utilizing dead weight and brute strength. Our Women’s Self Defense Program is a form of Submission Grappling, or simply No-Gi Jiu Jitsu. And it takes the same approach as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu catering to defending against attacks, the attacker(s) and countering attacks. Our program fosters self-confidence, teaches you how to protect yourself and your loved ones, while simulating situations that are confrontational. It also, facilitates weight loss, helps to build confidence, relieves stress, improves coordination, balance and flexibility, and promotes functional strength with a team building atmosphere. Here at Cobrinha BJJ LV, many women (mothers and wives too!) participate in our BJJ program. We also offer private, one-on-one classes for those interested in specialized training.

It helps develop self-confidence, learn discipline and familiarize children with the value of hard work. One of Sergio’s main philosophies is that hard work beats talent when talent does not work as hard. He and his other instructors believe that when you work hard and try your best at something you can do anything. Studies show that children who participate in martial arts perform better in school, are physically healthier, have improved decision-making, and are less likely to be influenced by peer pressure. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu teaches respect for others and respect of self. With bullying an issue in children’s lives, it is necessary to give them the tools to prevent bullying all together.

In joining the youth Jiu Jitsu program, your child will adapt leverage and technique in order to take out bigger, stronger opponents! Students will be separated at the beginning of class based on skill level, and under the watchful eye of UFC veteran coaches, Rick Davis and Roxanne Modafferi, the children will learn everything from a proper base, wrestling, escaping compromising positions and effectively neutralizing an opponent. There are two types of Jiu Jitsu classes but only one difference. Traditional Brazilian Jiu Jitsu requires a Kimono and belt whereas Grappling requires shorts and a rash guard (or t-shirt). Both classes are instrumental in creating a well-rounded Jiu Jitsu athlete! Keeping in line with the concept of providing a structured graduation program, we have developed a class curriculum that holds the student responsible for certain techniques which they are tested over in order to advance to the next rank. This is to ensure the student will set short-term goals on their long journey toward black belt, discouraging them from getting frustrated along the way. Copies of these curriculums are available on the attendance card table in the gym.

We are the most authentic Israeli martial arts school in Southern Nevada, featuring classes in all major aspects of Israeli self defense and martial arts. We offer classes for adults, children, women, families, security teams and Law Enforcement Officials. Long before the current MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) trend of combining martial arts styles started in the US, Dr. Dennis Hanover was fusing, Karate, Judo and Ju-Jitsu (sometimes spelled Jiu-Jitsu) together to create a unique self-defense/fighting style that could be taught to both civilians and Israeli military personnel – the system is now taught to elite units in the Israeli army, as well as the Mossad. This unique and effective system is now offered in Henderson, Las Vegas by Tomer Steinberg, 5th Degree Black Belt, and 2011 World Champion – the highest ranked instructor of the system in the U.S. One of the things that distinguish Dennis-Hisardut from other “modern” self-defense systems is that it continues to teach the traditional message and values of the martial arts, such as: respect, integrity and honor, believing that it is these values which underpin and power the skills and techniques that the system teaches. This is why the style adds value to everybody’s day-to-day life as well as developing the survival mindset that is so crucial when dealing with a real-life assault or violent incident. The Center for Israeli Martial Arts in Henderson is one of two US branches of Dennis Hisardut (Often referred to as Dennis Survival JuJitsu), teaching students of all ages and experience levels how to protect and stand up for themselves in any situation (as featured on the History Channel's ""Human Weapon"" Krav Maga episode). We offer a warm welcome to all who come and train with us and practice our message of respect both on and off the mats. If you would like to come and take a free class to see how Hisardut training can affect your life please call us at 702-530-3755";"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQSOblhQEMZ_viLnVuxA3FR-BBv69r0e32gb4vYBcG4la-vkeA8";"http://www.israelimartialartslv.com/children.html";"All our teaching is age appropriate i.e. what we teach and how we teach a 6 year old is very different to how we teach a twelve year old. What all our children’s martial arts programs have in common though is the aim of developing your child’s character. We view ourselves not just as a gym or stereo-typical martial arts studio but as an educational facility that your child associates with fun. By creating an environment which is fun and enjoyable to be in and teaching physical skills and techniques that your child can believe in we can also communicate a message of respect: for themselves and for others. The traditional martial arts approach of developing a relationship between instructor and student (often referred to as “scared space”) in a mentoring fashion means that our school can reinforce the positive message(s) that your child receives both at home and at school. We don’t just want to see your child improve on the mats and in their physical abilities but in all aspects and areas of their life. In a world of the “Gamebox” and “Playstation” we can help bring a level of normality and reality into a child’s life. By getting young children and teens into a habit of engaging in physical activity at an early age they are likely to carry on and continue this practice into their adult years. Introducing this type of discipline into their lives now will pay dividends later. We believe fully in the benefits of martial arts training and practice what we preach: both our young daughters train in Hisardut and we see the positive influence it has on their lives.";;;;;;;"Tomer Steinberg";;;"https://www.facebook.com/The-Center-For-Israeli-Martial-Arts-497570643770322/";;;;1;912;

The classes themselves are taught in a fun and entertaining way, but the techniques themselves are very real, very effective, and must be used carefully. Each class begins with a very active warmup. It is followed by standard drills that are done each class to build muscle memory and solid fundamentals. After this, there are unique techniques taught for that class.

Statistics show that one out of four children are bullied in school or online. Many believe that fear of bullying may be the leading cause of low self-confidence in children. Worse, statistics suggest that only 36% of bullying is reported. At Savarese BJJ, we focus on the physical, emotional and mental well-being of our students. We call them”Life Skills.” We provide our young students with the most powerful defensive skills so they will be ready to stand up against bullies. Additionally, we assist our students with the development of characteristics and skills they will need in order to live a happy and balanced life. Our students develop confidence, discipline, courage, responsibility, and leadership among other important values. We promote non-violent resolutions to conflict. For many children learning to respect authority can be a difficult lesson to learn. Respecting authority is quite important in the teaching of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. We aim to develop life-improvement skills as well as building the child’s character in a positive way. Our belief is uncoachable kids become unemployable adults. We teach these skills in the most fun atmosphere possible. Lyndhurst NJ Children’s Martial Arts is beneficial in many ways. Children who participate in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu classes quickly increase their physical fitness level. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu involves both large and small muscle groups in the body. Improvement of physical well-being is not the only goal.

Our women’s program was specifically designed to prepare women for real life threatening situations. In addition, our self defense techniques provide the knowledge and skills for any woman to escape from her attacker, whether she is on her feet or on the ground. This course is unique because it does not rely exclusively on punching and kicking like other forms of martial arts. Punching and kicking do not represent an effective strategy against an assailant who is bigger, stronger and capable of hitting back. In addition, they are useless on the ground, which is where an attacker is most likely to assault a woman. It is structured to achieve maximum comfort for females interested in pursuing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. This class offers a relaxed, non-threatening environment ideal for the beginner or intermediate student to grow and learn quickly under the guidance of experienced and highly-accomplished female instructors. Men are not allowed in the room where the classes will be taking place unless they are an instructor. We understand that some women feel intimidated stepping inside a martial arts school with more experienced students or with the majority of male students.

The best way to predict your child's future is to help create it right now. You've heard about the many benefits martial arts training provides children like self-confidence, improved motor skills, self-discipline, concentration, and respect. Unfortunately, most children themselves, are not particularly interested in developing those traits, their parents are. Children are children and they want to be involved in activities that are fun and immediately rewarding. That is why the children's programs at The EDGE are different than typical Martial Arts Schools. In the past, traditional training for children has meant a robotic, rigid, and militaristic class where every child looks and moves the exact same way. Keeping children interested in this kind of environment can sometimes be a task for the teacher and an even bigger task for the parents who have to ""drag"" the child to class. Our approach is unique because we teach your children to take advantage of the way their bodies move and react naturally. Our classes are motivating and designed to stimulate your child through positive and memorable experiences throughout the class. Children have a natural desire to be good at whatever it is they do, therefore they will quickly notice that the best students have the most self discipline, and will strive to copy their success. Every parent comes with specific goals and desires for their child and we strive to meet them in every class. Your children are the reason we are here and we will do our utmost to earn your confidence in our programs and instructors. Child abduction protection is also taught as part of the children's program in an eight-week cycle during class using ""What if"" questions and stranger awareness drills.";;;"Sil Jun Do®, Muay Thai Kickboxing, MMA, Grappling ";;"https://www.theedgemma.com/schedule";;"Justin Rios";;;"https://www.facebook.com/theedgeuma/";;;;1;;

To achieve this, we combine the greatest benefits of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Submission Wrestling and Judo. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu -is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting with the goal of gaining a dominant position and using powerful chokeholds to force an opponent to submit or be knocked out. BJJ promotes the principle that a smaller, weaker person using leverage and proper technique can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant. Submission Grappling and Judo teach you how to escape holds and grabs using techniques such as throws, joint locks and submission. These defenses are most useful in close-range altercations and protection after being forced to the ground.";"http://hillsboroughbjj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/image.png?quality=100.3016041119500";"http://hillsboroughbjj.com/kids-program/";"Fast-paced, fun-filled classes are approximately 50 minutes long.

Constantly evolving, we are always refining our approach and exposing students to leading edge concepts and training styles for a skill set which is widely considered the most critical for success in MMA (mixed martial arts), self-defense and street defense. Unlike Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Kickboxing or Boxing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu focuses on taking down and controlling an opponent while using throws, takedowns and submissions to dominate the attacker. Striking is an incorporated element as a last resort while dominating an opponent in a self-defense situation. As a sport, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is invigorating and suitable for practitioners of all ages and builds. Our sport does not give itself to a specific body type and only reward the most athletic. As techniques are designed on scientific principles of leverage, even a smaller practitioner will quickly learn to control and dominate much larger opponents. This makes training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu ideal for women and children as well as men of all ages. The physical fitness benefits are unrivaled as BJJ develops anaerobic fitness as well as aerobic fitness while giving practitioners explosive power when and where they need it the most; it is a dynamic and changing workout which will challenge the practitioner in ways that moving weights around never can. Most importantly, at Battle Born Jiu Jitsu, we are focused on bringing out the very best in every person, so they can develop and improve physically as well as mentally to become the best version of themselves in every aspect of their lives.";"https://battlebornjiujitsulv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BATTLE-BORN-JJ-1.png";"https://battlebornjiujitsulv.com/services/kids-jiu-jitsu/";"Jiu Jitsu is an excellent martial art for children.

Classes are structured to constantly engage kids and teens in the learning process – without overwhelming them with information. Each 45-minute class is an appropriate, entertaining mix of drills and games to reinforce learned techniques and encourage cooperation and communication. As a developmental activity, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu promotes mental clarity and strength, respect, discipline and character, and that applies for children and adults alike. It’s also an amazing way to build lasting friendships. In keeping with the philosophy of Guerrilla Jiu Jitsu, our curriculum teaches self defense and addresses the issue of bullying with verbal and physical de-escalation techniques intended to stop a bullying situation in its tracks. Students are also empowered to determine their own success by learning to take responsibility for themselves and their actions. Kids learn to focus, pay attention to detail, think critically and practice respect – skills that serve them on and off the mats, at home and in school.
