Or maybe you just want a fun way to keep fit, learning useful skills for you or your kids? Well, that's what our Jiu-jitsu/self-defense programs in Vancouver/Richmond, BC are all about. At our dojo, a 2014 'Best of Richmond' pick in the Richmond Review, we teach Can-Ryu Jiu-jitsu concepts that work around differences in size & strength to defend against strikes, body grabs, ground attacks & weapons, using a combination of strikes, kicks & blocks in our Women's Self-Defense classes, with the addition of throws/takedowns, improvised weapons, joint locks (adults only), etc, in our Jiu-jitsu classes. Can-ryu is a modern Canadian adaption of Japanese Jiu-jitsu that works for people of all sizes & abilities. We emphasize applying self-defense skills in accordance with Canadian laws.";"http://pacificwavejiujitsu.com/our-logo_files/stacks-image-803c47b-617.jpg";"http://pacificwavejiujitsu.com/kids-martial-arts.html";"At PWJJ, we provide age-specific martial arts programs designed to teach with each age range’s developmental needs in mind. The 3-4 year-old class teaches basic foundational movement skills through martial arts exercises while learning to engage in a class environment. The 5-7 year-old class uses more advanced martial arts skills and exercises as a platform for developing physical, intellectual, social and emotional skills for their age range. The Junior Jiu-jitsu class for 8-10 year olds introduces the Can-ryu Jiu-jitsu curriculum emphasizing self-defense applications with some modifications keeping their children's mental and physical developmental stage in mind. For all our kids martial arts programs, we provide a fun, safe & positive learning environment in which your child develops confidence, focus and self-esteem.

So we've put together this 3-hour 'Self-Defense for Busy Women' course held in Richmond BC in the Vancouver area to give you personal safety and awareness skills, as well as basic self-defense tools and concepts that you can learn and master quickly (and may even save your life!). Not all courses teach the most important aspects of women's self-defense. Read 4 Common Problems with Women's Self-Defense Classes for more info. We teach using awareness & intuition, predator identification, and verbal strategies as being the first line of defense, while also teaching practical physical women's self-defense moves that use gross motor skills, making them easy to learn and use while under the adrenaline-filled, high stress context of an attack. Self-Defense for Busy Women will teach you: To use awareness, listen to your intuition and identify predatory behaviour; How to perform verbal de-escalation; 6 practical strikes for self-defense, each of which can be learned in under 3 minutes; Fundamentals of the ""Simple Hold Escape System""; Self-defense from the ground; How to react to an attack; How items in your personal surroundings can be used as ""weapons of opportunity"" We offer our women's self-defense classes around once every 1-2 months, but may offer additional classes if there is enough demand. If our schedule doesn't work for you, you can also request to have this class run for a private group (minimum 5 students).

Elements from many martial arts systems, including jujitsu, Isshin-Ryu, Shotokan, and Taekwondo have influenced the development of Taiho-Ryu. Drawing heavily from Taiho-Jutsu, a jujitsu style used by the Japanese police forces, the system blends these elements into an effective style of self defense, with the emphasis on practicality, rather than sport.

However, they need to be aware of their choices and learn to be responsible for their choices. Unfortunately, statistics show that once an individual is victimized (regardless of the level) they are more susceptible to be victimized again. Additionally, each time the level intensifies.

It is a unique style of no gi Brazilian Jiu Jitsu which was made to work both inside the cage and on the sporting mats. The intentionality behind the creation was to have an unorthodox style which could keep an opponent under constant control and in the threat of danger. The 10th Planet system was put to the test in Abu Dhabi 2003, and it succeeded masterfully by facilitating Eddie Bravo's victory over long time reigning champion Royler Gracie. Immediately following that victory, Eddie opened his own school to further the system. What separates 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu from other styles is its innovation and evolution. Some of the moves, like the Rubber Guard, the Twister, and the Lock-Down have taken the Jiu Jitsu community by storm because of their originality and effectiveness. The moves mentioned here are so different that opponents do not know how to react to them and they leave the practitioner in a unique position to execute with little to no defense from their opponent. Moreover, the beauty of the system does not stop there: Eddie and his students are constantly inventing new moves and counters to old moves in order to keep the style relevant and functioning. So, where other systems cease to grow, 10th Planet finds itself in a situation where its entire focus is to continue its own growth";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/48e540_1051dc336c59480baeaebb2a15931db5.png/v1/fill/w_424,h_290,al_c/48e540_1051dc336c59480baeaebb2a15931db5.png";;;;;;;"https://www.10thplanetphx.com/schedule";;"John Botello";;"info@10thPlanetPhx.com";"https://www.facebook.com/10thplanetphx/";"https://www.youtube.com/user/10thplanetjjphx";"https://youtu.be/wdSivE9ECWk";;1;51;

He started his dedication to training with Rigan Machado in 2000 for approximately 10 months before he made a change that would span well over a decade. Paul trained under his mentor Gustavo Dantas/Nova Uniao from 2001-2015. During this time he found much growth, and opportunities in the BJJ community. One of Paul’s dreams was to teach others and share this sport that had changed his life in so many ways. He took his first teaching job in 2007. After being a BJJ instructor through several valuable experiences he knew it was time to open his very own school. While Nava BJJ the program had already found its way into his past opportunities, Nava BJJ the school opened its doors in August of 2010. For 2 years the small location grew, and it was obvious that a larger space was needed. So after 2 years of growth the next location opened its doors, and has been thriving ever since. As of October Nava BJJ is now affiliated with Samir Chantre BJJ. One of Paul’s most valuable endeavors is founding the D.A.N. tournament. In its 3rd year the DAN was Named after his son who alongside his wife, and daughter suffer from a disease called Neurofibromatosis type 2. This event has become a great success in helping bring awareness to a cause so important to the Nava BJJ family.

As a college student in the early 1980’s, he began studying Hwa Rang Do. After nearly 10 years of intensive training, he received his black belt from the Grand Master himself, Dr. Joo Bang Lee, in 1994. He currently holds a 3rd degree black belt. After a number of fights over the years, Chris began to realize that most techniques taught in traditional martial arts just aren’t effective in real street fights. In early 2007, after a few more altercations, Chris followed his dream and ventured to the Gracie World HQ in Torrance, CA and began his journey with the Gracie family. After being fully exposed to the simplicity, efficiency and effectiveness of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, Chris stopped training in other martial arts altogether, and dedicated all of his efforts to learning the Gracie Way. Soon thereafter, he retired his black belt. Seeing his dedication and potential, his teacher, Ryron Gracie, recruited Chris into the Instructor Certification Program, held at the Gracie Academy. Chris graduated from the 2nd ICP, in 2008. He now focuses 100% of his time and energies on learning, and teaching Gracie Jiu-Jitsu to the world. Chris has been teaching for over 25 years, and currently teaches full time at his CTC, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Scottsdale. He also teaches law enforcement on a regular basis. He holds a BS in Psychology from Northern Arizona University (1988) and began working on his Master’s degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine, in 1990. He is also a 5th generation Reiki Master Teacher.";"http://graciescottsdale.com/wp-scottsdale/uploads/2013/12/GracieLogo.png";"http://graciescottsdale.com/bullyproof/";"Studies suggest that bullying may be the leading cause of low self-esteem in children, and according to some surveys, less than 15% of kids actually report acts of bullying. Children’s inability to stand up to a bully is rooted in profound fear for their personal safety. Ironically, the victims know that they must confront the bully and would like nothing more than to stand up to them. But, they simply can’t follow through for fear of the physical harm that backs the bully’s every action. And, therein lies the challenge - how do you instill in a victim of bullying the confidence to face the tormentor, look them in the eye, and back them down? The answer is simple - teach the victims to defend themselves against physical attack, and the rest will follow. Little Champs (4-7 Years Old) The Little Champs program is for kids 4-7 years old. Using our time-tested “Gracie Games,” we teach the Little Champs basic self-defense techniques while instilling the foundational principles of leverage and control. The secret to the success of this program is that we make the lessons so fun that the kids beg for more! Once a child masters all ten Gracie Games, they advance to the Jr. Grapplers program. Jr. Grapplers (8-13 Years Old) - In the Jr. Grapplers program, we focus on 33 non-violent self-defense techniques that teach children to “neutralize and negotiate” with the bullies. Verbal assertiveness strategies are a major portion of this curriculum. A child needs absolutely no experience to start, and we guarantee a noticeable increase in your child’s confidence within a few weeks! Black Belt Club (Invitation Only) - We invite children who excel in the Jr. Grapplers program to join the Black Belt Club. This is our most advanced youth jiu-jitsu program and joining the Black Belt Club is the highest honor for any youth Gracie Jiu-Jitsu practitioner.

We also have a great facility with equipment for weight training and we incorporate Ninja Warrior type drills into our programs, said Tei. “In recent years, the style Tei teaches called Wing Chun has exploded in popularity due to the Ip Man movies depicting the life of Bruce Lee’s grandmaster,” said Tei, who also works as a fight choreographer and actor, most recently enlisted by DC Entertainment’s “DC All Access” webseries to star as Batman in a soon to be released fighting tutorial aimed at fans who want to learn the Caped Crusader’s signature moves. Although created by a woman, the Wing Chun style is equally popular with men — famous practitioners include Robert Downey Jr., Christian Bale, Jackie Chan, and of course, Bruce Lee. Even the children are trained to hone their combat skills, albeit in an age-appropriate setting. “With the kids, it’s more about awareness: teaching them to identify and avoid bullies and dangerous adults. Parents choose us because our classes are fun, not overly formal or stiff.” On review sites, parents echo Tei’s sentiments, with one father raving, “3 months into MA FIT LA, he got student of the month, grades rocketed up, and now his confidence level is high without the cockiness.” “The best thing about MA FIT LA and the styles we offer is that we cover everything you could want in martial arts: it works on the street, it’s fun to learn, it helps you balance and center yourself,” said Tei. “When our students work to master Wing Chun, they’re really working on mastering themselves.”";;"http://www.mafitla.com/childrens-classes/";"PANDAS (AGES 3-5) Looking for martial arts for your preschooler ages 3-5? Read on! At MA FIT LA, we offer our Little Pandas unparalleled benefits through a fun martial arts curriculum that teaches the life skills they need for elementary school and beyond. Some Los Angeles parents commute an hour each way to bring their kids ages 3-5 to our Little Pandas Kung Fu program. Fun. Structured. Personalized. Our Little Pandas curriculum is all of these things and more. Every single martial arts class is pre-planned to help your child build classroom etiquette, self-control, and self-confidence. What makes our Burbank children’s martial arts program different than the rest? Classes 7 days a week so even the busiest family can attend. Age-appropriate lessons – older children join Tigers (ages 5-7) or Dragons (ages 8-13). A focus on life skills so your child can excel at school, behave at home, and play confidently and nicely with other kid.  Individual attention with multiple instructors and helpers per class. We ask each Panda for their personal best! Monthly events including safety seminars (bullying, kidnapping and street safety awareness), family days, and themed days such as Superhero Day and Ninja Day. Kung Fu is Super Fun! We teach authentic Wing Chun Kung Fu, the style of Bruce Lee and Grandmaster Ip Man. The Little Pandas also learn Shaolin Kung Fu and Tai Chi. Each class will hone your child’s focus, discipline and control while enhancing their balance, fitness, and reflexes. Every single one of our instructors is an incredible martial artist from our own Adult/Teen program. No strangers off Craigslist. Just encouraging, friendly, passionate martial artists who love to teach kids. Safety from Kidnappers and Strangers. “When I ask new students what a stranger is, they usually tell me that they wear black and are very sneaky. When I ask them what they should do if they get lost at the store, they often describe going outside and looking for their parents’ car.They don’t know to dial 911 if there’s an emergency. They don’t know that they tell their parents right away if another adult asks them to keep a secret. Within a year of joining, most of my Burbank martial arts kids can answer every single question correctly without hesitation. And they can physically and vocally demonstrate how to fight off a kidnapper or dangerous adult.”  – Todd Shawn Tei, Program Director. TIGERS (AGES 5½-7) Why is our Tigers program so popular with parents seeking Burbank martial arts for kids ages 5-7? The answer is simple: here at MA FIT LA in Burbank, we transform children into confident, enthusiastic leaders. Children ages 5 to 7 are just deciding what type of students they will be. Will they excel in elementary school, willingly volunteering answers in class and playing happily during recess and parties? Or will they struggle academically and socially? Our Kids’ Kung Fu program teaches children that they can achieve anything with hard work, in and out of our martial arts program. There are hundreds of martial arts schools in Los Angeles, but many parents commute across town so their children can study Wing Chun Kung Fu with us. Here’s how one Northridge parent put it: Kids Learn Focus, Discipline and Confidence We teach Kung Fu, the style of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and many other famous martial artists. Of all the traditional martial arts, Kung Fu offers students the best tools to improve their physical, mental, and emotional fitness. Among other benefits, our Tigers work to improve their skills in the following areas: FOCUS: Focusing on the teacher and the task at han. WORK ETHIC: Setting a goal and following through. RESPECT: Respecting classroom rules and etiquette. PERSEVERANCE: Tackling difficult tasks with enthusiasm and confidence. SAFETY: More aware of safety rules and Stranger Danger. BULLY-PROOFED: Confident around bullies, compassionate toward other children. LEADERSHIP: Volunteering to lead and answer questions – no more wallflowers! The Tigers program teaches children age-appropriate lessons in the most popular martial arts in Los Angeles. Wing Chun Kung Fu is REALISTIC Self-Defense for Children. Wing Chun was the style of Bruce Lee and his teacher, Grandmaster Ip Man. Unlike most martial arts, which rely on brute strength, Wing Chun was invented by a Shaolin nun to be effective for smaller practitioners – perfect for your Kung Fu kid! Our children learn techniques and strategies to deter both bullies at school and kidnappers on the streets, while also learning when and how much force to use in each situation. You can breathe a little easier knowing that your children will learn how to protect themselves and find help anytime they feel threatened. More Discipline, Leadership and Fitness, Too Shaolin martial arts and Tai Chi, such as what you’ve seen practiced by Jackie Chan and Jet Li, builds discipline, fitness, balance and strength. These life skills will improve your child’s performance in the classroom and in their other extracurricular activities. DRAGONS (AGES 8-13) Looking for martial arts for older children and pre-teens? Read on for more info! Here at MA FIT LA  in Burbank, we know you want the very best for your kids. Read more to learn why parents call us the best Los Angeles martial arts school for children. Our martial arts programs for children are completely unique, which is why many of our Kung Fu kids commute from La Crescenta, Pasadena, Beverly Hills, Northridge and West LA. We offer age-appropriate training for Little Pandas (ages 3-5), Tigers (ages 5-7), and Dragons (ages 8-13). Why do parents skip over the martial arts schools in their own towns to bring their kids to us? As one of our students put it: Real World Self-Defense Training Kids Kung Fu. The Dragons program will help your child/pre-teen (ages 8-13) develop physical, mental, and emotional discipline while perfecting their martial arts technique. Your child needs these skills to navigate the academic and social pressures of junior high. They need the self-confidence to say “Yes, I can” as well as the self-respect to say “No, I won’t.” Our Dragons learn advanced Wing Chun techniques and apply their skills in drills and sparring. Wing Chun, the style of Bruce Lee, is widely considered the best martial arts style for self-defense because it focuses on training for the real world, not tournaments. We cover the entire Wing Chun system with our Dragons. With hard work and commitment, our highest level Dragons learn aspects of the Wing Chun system even Bruce Lee didn’t know. Dragons also study Shaolin Kung Fu and Tai Chi to hone their fitness, focus, and balance. With increased focus, your child may begin to achieve better grades at school, laying a stronger foundation for the tough academics taught in junior high and high school. Children receive many conflicting messages about life: from us, from their friends, and especially, from the media. For generations, parents have turned to traditional martial arts in Burbank to ensure their children learn respect, discipline, and compassion for others. Our goal every day is simple: encourage your children to do a little better than they did the day before. Could your “C” student be a “B” student with just a little more self-esteem? Could your “mostly As” student turn into a “straight A” student with just a little more motivation? Benefits of Our Dragons Program. Their self esteem will increase. They will develop strong leadership skills and abilities, including public speaking — no more being too shy to answer questions in the classroom! They will learn how to follow directions and not talk back to their elders. They will learn realistic self-defense skills, with different techniques for use in bullying and kidnapping scenarios. They will drill how to handle school bullies without fighting, while also learning how to defend themselves if a school confrontation turns violent. We teach your child the “I CAN DO IT” attitude, rather than the “WHY SHOULD I TRY” thought process.";;;"Martial Arts, Kickboxing";;;;"Todd Shawn Tei";;"info@mafitla.com";"https://www.facebook.com/mafitlosangeles/";"https://www.youtube.com/user/camawingchun";"https://youtu.be/Gr717yFKNbs";;1;302;"No BJJ Classes"

The Gracie Barra Future Champions Program was created to provide children ages 3-15 with an environment that allows them to experience and understand core values like focus, discipline, persistence, cooperation and respect. As a contact sport, Gracie Barra Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provides a very challenging yet safe and caring environment for a child to mature towards a real life champion.The outcome of continued childhood practice of GB BJJ goes far beyond the accomplishments on the mats. The discipline and excellence demanded by our instructors often carries over to the child’s behavior at home and at school. Our Future Champions Program is typically subdivided in three different groups to accommodate students of different ages and skill levels: Little Champions I (3-6 years old), Little Champions II (7-9 Years Old), Juniors & Teens (10-14 years old).";"http://gbchino.com/programs/women-program/";"Aside from all classes offered in the Adults Gracie Barra Program Structure, our school offers a set of classes designed to introduce women to the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. As a martial art designed to allow the weaker to defeat the stronger, BJJ is a perfect fit for women who are interested in learning how to protect themselves ? and who wouldn’t be, right? The Gracie Barra Women’s Program combines a comprehensive self-defense curriculum with emphasis on drills that simulate realistic attack and escape situations. The techniques are complemented by a strong fitness component that is second to none compared to classes offered in regular gyms. Classes specially designed for women like Rape Prevention, BJJ Conditioning and social “get togethers” are added benefits to the ordinary GB activities and create a strong bond between the members of the “Gracie Barra Pink Team.”";;;"http://gbchino.com/programs/schedule/";;"Rafael Oliveira";"Free Class";"info@gbchino.com";"https://www.facebook.com/gbchino/";;;;1;305;

We are the premier Jiu-Jitsu academy in the Inland Empire. We have students who travel from as far away as Upland, Diamond Bar, Alta Vista, Rancho Cucamonga, Irvine, Corona, Ontario, Glendora, West Covina, Brea, Anaheim, Walnut and other areas just to train at Ralph Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Chino Hills. What makes Ralph Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Chino Hills different from any other Jiu-Jitsu academy around? We care about you, the student, more than anything else and want you to receive the best training you can possibly receive. Our rates are comparable with other Jiu-Jitsu academies and we offer much more. We have classes Monday-Saturday mornings and evenings, and have an open mat on Sundays. All of our adult Jiu-Jitsu classes are 1-1/2 hours long, which is a ½ hour longer than other schools, and your monthly rate does not go up as you advance in your belt ranking. We also do not have any hidden charges that you find out about after you have been training for several months and are ready to “move into the intermediate program.” Most importantly, at Ralph Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Chino Hills your classes are always taught by black belts that have been teaching with us since we opened our doors. We do not have a “revolving door” of instructors. And, our black belts will actually train with our students on the mat, not just stand around and watch from the sidelines. We pride ourselves in having the best black belt instructors around, not the blue, purple or brown belts instructors that other Jiu-Jitsu and MMA schools in the area have. We promise that Ralph Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Chino Hills will give you the best training for whatever you are looking for whether it be competition, exercise, weight loss, self-defense or just to be part of a family. Our atmosphere is very friendly and inviting. We also offer Muay Thai, Judo, and No-Gi Classes for Adults. Ralph Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Chino Hills also has the best childrens Jiu-Jitsu program. Our childrens classes are taught by two black belts. Our children learn discipline and Jiu-Jitsu in our very family friendly atmosphere that will help them should they ever become a victim of bullying. Some of our kids compete, but most of them come because they have fun learning the techniques and interacting with each other, as well as the instructors. Being a part of our Jiu-Jitsu family will give them the confidence they need to help succeed in life and to make friends. Unlike other martial arts, we do not charge for belt promotions. You will never have to pay extra for your child to move up in the belt system or for “testing.” Jiu-Jitsu is the real deal. You will never see a six or seven year old black belt. Nor will your kids have katas, or forms, to memorize and put to music. They will learn ground fighting technique to use in the real world. We also offer Muay Thai, Wrestling and Judo for the kids. Many Ralph Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Chino Hills students have gone on to do extremely well at tournaments and some have become World Champions and known throughout the Jiu-Jitsu community for their excellence should competition be of interest to you. We have also had students lose a significant amount of weight it that's your goal. Jiu-Jitsu is much more fun than going to the gym and lifting weights or using other machines. So, if your interest is competition, exercise, or you just want to come to a friendly environment to learn Jiu-Jitsu and be part of a family, stop by and visit.

FSMAC offers two outstanding martial arts programs: Mu Sool Won and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. In our Mu Sool Won program our kids, teens and adults will get to learn the dynamic martial art of Mu Sool Won, a system that encompasses all aspects of martial arts such as kicking, punching, throwing, joint locking, break falls, effective self defense, both modern and traditional weapons as well as fitness, while all being taught in a family friendly and non competitive environment.

We help your children build confidence. Winning a match against a friend you couldn’t beat last week builds confidence. Being able to move a little faster and get a little stronger builds confidence. Competing in a competition builds confidence. Classes begin with a warm-up. When Professor Sean Huff teaches, the warm-up usually includes jogging, forward and backward rolls, wheelbarrows, army crawls, bear crawls, and shrimping. Professor Dusty Alexander teaches a little differently. He likes to warm up with games. Kids don’t realize it, but by the end of the games, their faces are bright red and their hearts are pumping! Both warm-up styles not only provide cardiovascular exercise, but they teach some of the physical skills required to perform BJJ techniques. All instruction is done in an age-appropriate way. Students watch the demonstration and then try the technique with their partner. After the Professors show technique, the kids get to roll with each other in timed matches. This is usually their favorite part of class. Often children of equal size and ability are paired with each other during matches, but not always. When a beginner goes against a seasoned kid, they really challenge themselves by working as hard as they can to submit their more experienced peer. The older kids are very aware of their strength and take care not hurt the younger kids. Children are always welcome to watch a class before they decide to participate.
