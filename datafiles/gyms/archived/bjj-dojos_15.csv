Through our association with Guro Dan Inosanto, our roots are in Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do training and philosophy. We believe that cross training the various  martial arts we teach opens the student's mind and nurtures an adaptable martial artist. Different training methods enhance different physical and mental attributes. For example, the double stick work from Kali (Filipino Martial Arts) enhances perceptual speed and coordination, the pad work from Muay Thai Kickboxing gives us a powerful striking base while providing an amazing cardio workout, the study of Jiu-jitsu teaches intricate problem solving while dealing with real pressure and full body engagement. This is just a small example of the benefits of martial arts cross training but is the underlying concept of the SIMA program and an important principle of the JKD philosophy. Cross-training in all disciplines is highly encouraged but not required.  We have classes that combine arts (Kali/JKD and IMA), as well as classes that focus on one area (Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai Kickboxing, and Self-Defense).";"https://www.simamartialarts.com/uploads/1/4/6/0/14608910/sima-white-muay-thai-square.png";"https://www.simamartialarts.com/juniors-7-10-yrs.html";"Effective November 2019, our Little Dragons, Juniors, and Seniors program is CLOSED to new students.

It utilizes leverage, locks and holds that can neutralize a bigger, stronger opponent.  Effective self-defense skills are taught while promoting an active and healthy lifestyle for children (ages 5-13) of all experience levels. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu introduces basic submission, defense, take-down, restraint, and escape techniques.  Children will learn how to move and control their bodies, increase strength and fitness, and improve coordination and athleticism.  They will also learn when it is appropriate to use BJJ techniques, practice self-control and respect, and work as a cooperative team member.  These skills will not only improve their quality of life, but can enhance performance in other sports and activities. Small class sizes with multiple instructors ensures your child receives the attention he/she needs.  All Rothwell MMA youth instructors are licensed by the State of Wisconsin, Department of Safety & Professional Services.  BJJ techniques are practiced with other students as well as with instructors.  Students apply their skills during grappling and structured games.  We make exercise, hard work, and learning fun! Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu keeps students excited about learning and progressing with a traditional belt system.  Students begin as a white belt and work their way towards a black belt.  After showing progress, a “stripe” is earned.  After 4 stripes, the student knows they are ready to test for their next level belt.  Belts are earned, not given.  Each belt test has a specific set of moves and techniques that must be demonstrated.  The student will know what is on the test and will practice the necessary techniques in the weeks leading up to the test. Click here to learn how to tie your BJJ belt! Once students are about 15 years old, they will graduate into the adult Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program.  BJJ is a martial art the can be practiced throughout life.  Just like riding a bike, it will always be with you.  There are endless techniques to learn, integrate, and practice.  After age 7, the students are invited to learn Youth Kickboxing, and around age 10, students may join Pankration.";;;"Kickboxing, MMA";;"http://rothwellmma.com/schedule/";"Mon, Wed, Fri: 4:00pm-7:30pm; Tues, Thurs: 11:00am-1:00pm, 4:00pm-8:30pm";"Ben Rothwell";"1 free trial class offer!";"info@rothwellmma.com";"https://www.facebook.com/RothwellMMA/";;;;1;1519;

The Bihonte system has as its core, five unique martial arts systems that each focus on various aspects of hand-to-hand combat. These five systems include Mokuraiken Kempo which is emphasized by lightning fast strikes and low kicks, Jeet Kune Do (Bruce Lee’s method of kickboxing and Wing Chun), ShihKeafma (Filipino Stick and Blade Arts), & Brazilian Jiu-jitsu/BJJ (specifically Pedro Sauer Gracie Jujitsu), and Hai Ki Chi Do (stand up Jiu-Jitsu), each of which was developed and practiced by various martial arts masters and founders who sought to develop one highly effective martial arts system that would incorporate and complement each of the individual systems and yet allow for effective fighting methods which incorporated a blend of striking, kicking, throwing, take downs, submissions, grappling, conditioning, joint locks, individual weapons training, and weapon disarmament. In addition to martial arts training the 54th Street Gym offers Fusion Fit training for men and women which is a unique form of heavy punching bag, focus mitt, thai pad, belly pad, shadow boxing, and plyometrics designed to use the body’s own natural weight for conditioning. It is an excellent way to get in shape, stay in shape, or improve your shape.";"http://54thstreetgym.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Combativos-e1522785286540.gif";"http://54thstreetgym.com/kids-program/";"Looking for a fun, exciting activity for your kids? Check out our kid’s martial arts in Murray, UT! At Integrated Martial Arts, we believe that the foundation of martial arts training should be a broad one. Our children’s martial arts classes draw upon the same great sources for striking, kicking, grappling, and self-defense as our adult classes, but provide that training in a single, integrated format designed specifically for a younger audience. Students will learn grappling from Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, striking from Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Taekwondo, Kempo and Kali, along with self-defense courses, and anti-bullying skills, all in a format that is fun and safe for kids of all ages. We have several programs for kids. Beginners and Advanced as well as a class that is actually done with the parents if they choose to participate. The Beginner Kid’s/Jr. Grappler’s class is for kids that are 7-15 years of age and who have never done any martial arts classes. In the Jr. Grapplers program, we focus on 30 non-violent self-defense techniques that teach children to “neutralize and negotiate” with the bullies. Verbal assertiveness strategies are a major portion of this curriculum. A child needs absolutely no experience to start, and we guarantee a noticeable increase in your child’s confidence within a few weeks! In addition to the Gracie Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, we teach the kids a combination of punching, kicking and simple self-defense skills. The other group is the Kids Advanced for kids 7-15 that have achieved at least a gold belt rank and above. If your child trained in another martial art they may be allowed to participate in this class after an initial assessment period. We want to make sure that every student has a good foundation to allow them to progress with the other kids in the class. Kids in this martial arts class will engage in controlled sparring and grappling. The parent/child class is for kids 4-7. It is done once a week and is often done with the parent so that the parents can work with the child thru the week. We teach the kids basic self-defense techniques while instilling the foundational principles of leverage and control. The secret to the success of this program is that we make the lessons so fun that the kids beg for more!";;;"Jeet Kune Do, Kali, Mokuraiken Kempo, Kickboxing Boot Camp";;"http://54thstreetgym.com/schedule/";;"Dan Berry";;"54thstreetgym@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/gracieacademyutah/";;;;1;1369;"Duplicate with id # 1587"

When teaching kids class, Professor Raths uses fun games and an easy teaching style to instill the fundamental techniques into his students. Why Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)? Brazilian Jiu Jitsu provides many benefits to children that continue through their lives. Problem-solving skills: Every class students are faced with new problems and situations, be it a new technique or simply a new partner. The constant change and application of knowledge learned is a great way to sharpen young developing minds. Discipline: Having the structure, respect, and discipline that BJJ provides translates well into all aspects of life, from school to home life. Physical Fitness: Another benefit to children who train BJJ that is often overlooked is the fitness aspect. During class, BJJ is sure to work your body as much as your mind. Social Benefits: On the mats, all students are equal, no matter what. This allows for the trust and dedication required to practice a martial art. BJJ brings together groups that may not have met any other way- leading to a diverse and beneficial social experience. Self Defense: Unfortunately, in today's world, it is a reality that being able to defend yourself is a benefit. At Groundwork Grappling, one of our primary lessons for all students is that we should never escalate or use force if there is a way to defuse the situation, however if it is necessary, we want our students to be able to defend themselves effectively and efficiently. At some point, most physical altercations end up on the ground- which is where Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is most useful.";;;;;"https://www.groundworkgrappling.com/pages/class-schedule";;"Jared Raths";;"groundworkgrappling@gmail.com";;;;;1;;

What started out as fitness boxing classes for a few people quickly transformed into a small, dedicated group of students who were interested in learning Boxing, Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. At this time Suzanne was training with Richard Bustillo and Helio Soneca, and bringing them both down to Huntsville to teach seminars in their respective arts. Over time, mostly through word of mouth, class sizes continued to grow.  Maverick then went from being a small club in a fitness gym to being one of the most recognizable and successful gyms in the Southeast. Though Maverick has grown, we have maintained the same small gym community atmosphere that we believe separates us from the rest.

Deciding to train in a martial arts program can be scary and cause you to consider giving up before you ever really get started.  My family and I experienced the same fears and questions many years ago when we began our journey.  We have been blessed in our martial arts career to train directly under the founder of our Taekwondo system Grandmaster Man Hee Han and have the privilege and opportunity to learn the style, techniques and philosophies directly from him and his son Master Yujin Han. When I started studying martial arts my daughters and eventually my wife joined with me. We have some of our most memorable trips and adventures because of this journey that we started and share together. We learn together, practicing at home together, and preparing each other for belt tests and competitions. There are a lot of families in our martial arts organization that study and train together. I would have never dreamed that all these years later I would be a Master Instructor and operate Academies teaching others martial arts and encouraging men, women and entire families to begin the same journey I began so many years before.  Many years after beginning my training with Grandmaster Han I was looking to diversify my training and add more opportunities in our Academy.  It was at this time that I was blessed for the second time in my training career.  I began training in Gracie Jiu-Jitsu under Grandmaster Rorion Gracie and his two sons Professors Ryron and Rener who are the son and grandsons of the creator of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, Grandmaster Helio Gracie. To say that I have been blessed and fortunate to train under two of the greatest martial arts families in history would be an understatement. By beginning your journey with us either in Youn Wha Ryu Taekwondo or Gracie Jiu-Jitsu you can guarantee that you are learning the lessons and techniques exactly in the manner in which the Grandmasters intended them to be learned!";;"http://gmhgjj.com/home/bullyproof";"Every month in the United States, three million children miss school due to fear of bullies. In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 13. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof program is for you! We are the ONLY Certified Training Center in Central Arkansas trained and authorized to offer your children this opportunity.";;;"Taekwondo";;"http://gmhgjj.com/home/schedule";"Mon-Fri: 4:00pm-10:00pm, Sat: 12:00pm-2:00pm, Sun: 4:00pm-6:00pm";"Tom Mullaney";;"gjjconway@gmail.com";;;;;1;;

We currently run three kid's programs (4-7 year olds, 8-11 year olds, and 12-15 year olds). As a self-defense method and as a contact sport, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provides a very challenging yet safe and caring environment for a child to mature towards a real-life champion. The outcome of continued childhood practice of TDT BJJ goes far beyond the accomplishments on the mats. The discipline and excellence demanded by our instructors often carry over to the child’s behavior at home and at school. The skills your child will learn in our specially designed classes will aid them in developing social skills, building self-confidence, and esteem, teaching them respect, patience, and concentration which will aid them in academic achievements. It has been proven that children who know how to defend themselves usually don't have to because they carry themselves in a more confident manner, and confidence alone is a deterrent to bullies and outsiders. The skills your child will learn in our school will help them to become more aware of their surroundings and avoid potentially dangerous situations, wherever they may occur. In addition to teaching, our instructors serve as positive role models and will aid your child's growth and development towards a positive attitude for life.";"http://tdtbjj.com/programs";"It is no secret the men and women are built differently and have different attributes.

Escaping locks or holds, creating space between you and an opponent, being able to get back to one's feet are emphasized as well.
