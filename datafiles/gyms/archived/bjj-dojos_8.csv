It’s about learning how to use your body in the best possible way - to take down any opponent of any size. You’ll develop control over your entire body, so you can use your whole body weight to take down opponents.  That’s how Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighters go into matches against guys twice, even three times their size… and come out victorious.  In the battle of technique vs. brute force… technique always wins.

Kids Learn How To Defend Themselves - Many different martial arts claim to teach self-defense, but not every style is practical in the real world. With the majority of physical altercations ending up on the ground, especially in the schoolyard, children must be prepared to defend themselves on the ground and control a bully without ever throwing a punch! Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is the non-violent, submission based self-defense system, trusted by everyone from our military and first responders to air marshals to defend themselves, diffuse a situation, and control an adversary. Build Confidence & Improve Their Behavior - Kids with high self confidence & high self esteem are happier & healthier, tend to have better behavior and fewer tantrums or lash outs, and they are much less likely to be targets for bullies! Jiu Jitsu is an individual sport that celebrates personal achievement and goal setting, and helps children understand their own body type as they develop a style that works to highlight their strengths, and minimize their weaknesses, and helps them become comfortable in their own skin. Its Great For Their Health! - Childhood obesity is on the rise with roughly 1 in 3 children classified as overweight. Schools are cutting the amount of time spent in gym, outdoor free play, and recess. In order for children to be physically healthy and maintain healthy bodies, they MUST participate in physical activity outside of school. Martial arts is a fantastic option for ALL children, especially those children who might, “ride the bench,” in team sports. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is designed for the smaller weaker opponent to be able to outskill and beat a much larger opponent. It will challenge everyone from the non-athlete to the superstar, and everyone in between.  They Get To Make Great Friends - Physical, emotional, and mental health are important, but what about “social health?’ Every kid needs friends, teammates, and mentors. Martial arts is a rare example of a sport where boys and girls practice together, leading to twice as many opportunities to build friendships. If your child makes friends easily, GREAT! They’ll make many more. If your child struggles to make friends or has some social difficulty in school, the environment at URSA Academy with other kids who share similar interests and experiences may be just what they need to break out of their shell, make friends, and have fun!";;;"Fitness Kickboxing";;;;"Kris Magers";;"Reception@URSAAcademy.com";"https://www.facebook.com/URSAAcademy/";"https://www.youtube.com/user/rjjaannarbor";"https://youtu.be/KLJcRiU_HVM";;1;787;

We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one.

World of Self-Defense in Minneapolis was founded by James Bob Easom. While serving in the US Navy, Bob Easom taught Karate, Judo and Ju-Jitsu (along with with noted AJJF/Hawaiian Ju-Jitsu instructor Bill Beach) at the former Twin Cities/Fort Snelling Naval Air Station, and decided to also offer training to the local civilian community. By 1968, we had a permenant location on Minnehaha Ave in South Minneapolis. In 1970, Bob Easom was relocated by the US Navy when the Twin Cities Naval Air Station was decommisioned, and World of Self-Defense was taken over by his top Black Belt, Ron Peterson (1943-2018), who had also trained at the Fort Snelling Naval Air Station's Judo & Ju-Jitsu club. World of Self-Defense was affiliated with the Armed Forces Judo Association, the American Judo and Jujitsu Federation (AJJF) and the Kodenkan Karate Association until the mid-1970's, when World of Self-Defense organized its Kosen Ju-Jitsu association which stressed realistic self-defense and ground grappling. During this time we moved to our current location at 5406 43rd Ave. World of Self-Defense/Combat Ju-Jitsu is now run by Ron Peterson's son Steve Peterson, who literally grew up with Ju-Jitsu, leading adult classes while still in his teens before eventually taking over the school from his father. Steve has been head instructor for more than 25 years. In the 1990's, ""Mixed Martial Arts"" events like the UFC increased public awareness of Ju-Jitsu's advantanges, and many students have found our club to be exactly what they were looking for.";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/cjj/Resources/cjjpatch5.gif";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/cjj/kids.html";"Our youth classes are popular with both boys & girls from 5 to 15. In addition to valuable self-defense skills, students will be able to develop: Self-discipline; Self-confidence; Respect for self and others; Focus/Attention; Good Sportsmanship; Good coordination & reflexes; Balance, strength, and agility; Leadership skills; Cooperation with others. All in a relaxed, fun, friendly environment!";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/cjj/wsd.html";"Ju-Jitsu for Women's Self-Defense: While ""Aerobic Kickboxing,"" ""Sport Karate"" and ""Classical"" or ""Traditional"" Martial Arts may be fun activities, they are often not effective against real-life aggressive attacks that ""go to the ground"", and unfortunately that's exactly where attacks on women often end up. If you are serious about learning effective self-defense, it is absolutely essential that you practice defending against a resisting opponent while you are on the ground as part of your training. That's what we're here for. Ju-Jitsu training will teach you to maximize your chances on the ground, where you can use leverage and positioning to defend against a larger attacker, instead of relying on upper-body strength. You will learn to use your whole body, and take advantage of your leg strength. We encourage women to attend our regular adult classes to gain valuable experience working with a wide variety of training partners. There is no substitute for regular training, and you will be amazed at what you will learn in just a few months. Across the country, more and more women are discovering the fun and effectivness of Ju-Jitsu training. Ju-Jitsu training can be hard work, and you will have a lot of close body contact with your training partner. Some people (and not just women!) are hesitant to learn Ju-Jitsu because the idea of rolling around with strange guys is just too uncomfortable. This close contact is a very important part of the learning process, and once you get to know your fellow students and instructors and learn how the techniques work, it quickly becomes a non-issue. The more experience you get in Ju-Jitsu class, the less likely you will panic in a real situation where someone is holding you down. You will always be in control of your training experience and we want you to be comfortable and enjoy your training with us.";;"Adult Class Rates: One Month $85, Four Months $290 ($72.50/month), One Year $800 (Less than $67/month!).

Our classes promote self-defense, physical training, and martial arts skills, in an effort to improve health and increase wellness. Our black belt curriculum is a system that incorporates training for the mind and body and is designed to teach martial arts skills and movement in a positive professional manner. Our self-defense practice is a system that utilizes what is effective for a variety of situations so that students can customize their training and create their own style of martial arts practice. You will learn defensive tactics that teach you to prevent and avoid and evade and disarm, strike and escape, control and submit. You will learn combat techniques for close quarter hand to hand, ground fighting, takedowns, control positions, submissions and weapons defenses. We teach situational awareness and how to predict, prevent and avoid a confrontation before you have to use physical defensive tactics. We study local and national trends relating to assault and violent crime and use that information to guide our self-defense. However, martial arts is more than a method of self-protection from an attacker it’s a self-protection from all those invisible enemies in life that can drag us down; sedentary or toxic lifestyle, anger, and stress, fear, worry, perfectionism, apathy, distraction and the like. Learning how to control an opponent in a self-defense situation is the context that we use to concentrate our training but the benefits extend far beyond basic self-defense. We know that the real challenges in life aren’t so easily defeated and require practice, patience, and perseverance to overcome. For us, martial arts is challenging, interesting, fun and enriching path to fitness that combines thousands of years of history, culture, and philosophy.

Co-founded by three friends and training partners-Harvy Berman, Scott Lewis, and Bill Thompson- Warrior Way would soon grow to become the best Martial Arts academy in the state of Michigan Warrior Way has a large kids program taught by instructors with backrounds in education. The practice of Martial Arts is a routine that improves focus and self discipline, developing the mind as well as the body. Students learn to control themselves to respect others, which naturally leads to a respect for self, improving self-esteem and self-confidence. This benefit often carries over into school, helping to not only improve behavior, but academic performance. Experts agree that, rather than promoting violence, Martial Arts open the door to building a solid foundation of self-confidence and a healthy sense of self worth. The core philosophy of Warrior Way’s Kids training is non-violence. When faced with a violent situation, our students are trained to respond in a calm and controlled way that will stop, rather than escalate, violence. Warrior Way has the distinction of having the longest running Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program in the state. Almost every school and instructor in Michigan can trace their training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu back to Warrior Way. Second-Degree Black Belt Professor Harvy Berman has worked tirelessly to help grow the sport in Michigan. With over 20 years of experience, Professor Harvy can trace his lineage back to the Gracie Family, who developed the art in Brazil almost 90 years ago. Warrior Way also has the only full-time staff of several Black Belts teaching all the classes at Warrior Way. In 2003, Warrior Way added the skills of World Champion Muay Thai Kickboxer Matee Jedeepitak to its already impressive staff of instructors. During his time as a professional fighter, Matee held two of the most prestigious titles in his homeland of Thailand, the Lumpinee and World Muay Thai Council championships. During his time in the United States, Matee also added the I.K.F. Pro San Shou Welterweight World Championship to his collection. With over 200 professional fights, there is no one in the midwest that has achieved what Matee has inside the rings of Thailand. As an instructor, Matee uses his lifelong experience to help students perfect the traditional style of Muay Thai Kickboxing at Warrior Way and across the country in his seminars. Our goal at Warrior Way is to help people better their lives through self confidence, discipline and physical fitness that training in the Martial Arts can bring. Based on reality, our systems provide you with a realistic form of self-defense that anyone, regardless of age or physical ability, can learn. Though Warrior Way has produced several BJJ World Champions, Muay Thai Champions, as well as amateur and professional MMA champions, Warrior Way’s number one priority us teaching the basics in a structured and safe enviornment. As a way of honoring those who protect us, Warrior Way also worlds closely with the local law enforcement to help keep those in uniform safe while on duty.";"http://www.warriorway.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ww_logo2.png";"https://www.warriorway.com/programs/warrior-way-kids-youth/";"Warrior Way Little Warriors Classes: These classes are open to any child ages 4, 5 and 6 years old.

In fact, many believe that fear of bullying may be the leading cause of low self confidence in children. Worse, statistics suggest that less then 15% of kids actually report acts of bullying. We know that most bullies are insecure and seek self esteem by harassing smaller or weaker children. Mash Gym has three objectives with our kids classes: 1. Boost confidence: Bullies are less likely to target self confident children. We instill confidence by teaching techniques that will neutralize the attack of a larger opponent. 2. Increase awareness: Harassment from bullies can be physical or verbal and delivered at various intensity levels. In each lesson, we focus on teaching your child to recognize and respond to the most common physical and verbal bully behaviors. 3. Be ready: Only when your child makes it clear that he/she will not tolerate the harassment, will they free themselves of the bullies torment. We will prepare them for every common contingency. Furthermore, we teach children how to diffuse confrontations with words and never to initiate physical aggression. If attacked, we offer techniques to non-violently neutralize the threat and gain control until help arrives. At Mash Gym we teach the children how to “fight fire with water.” Besides equipping your child with all these skills on the mats, and playground, we have also added the character development program. Aside from preparing your child to deal with bullies, the other objective of our program is to instill your child the character traits that will lead to success in all areas of life. There are eight chapters in the character development program: Tolerance; Perseverance; Courage; Responsibility; Health; Respect; Strength; Honor";;;"Muay Thai, Boxing, Bootcamp, BoxFit, Restorative Therapeutic Massage";;"https://www.mashgym.com/Schedule.html";;"Todd Allee";"Want to learn more about the experience here at Mash Gym?

We make sure that each and every member gets the personal attention they need to achieve their goals all while also having fun. We make relationships the highest of our concerns over everything else because at the end of the day, we know that if you don't like your own team, you aren't going to be apart of it (and you shouldn't!). The moment you step into Warrior Combat Academy, you are apart of the team and held to the same standards as the rest of us. And those standards are to abide by our no-ego policy, work with your partner at an appropriate pace, and ask questions! These standards help keep everyone on the same page and working as a functional team. Though we are an MMA gym, what we do is far more than fight. We instill newfound confidence and educate the community on self defense. We take otherwise helpless individuals and turn them into confident, contributing members of not just our gym, but society.

Shortly after starting, he realized how much he was drawn to the jiu jitsu and made it his primary art with muay thai right behind it.  He received his black belt in jiu jitsu in March, 2016 from Sifu Chris McCune, who is a 3rd degree black belt under the legendary Rigan Machado.  He has also had the privilege of training muay thai the last 5 years with  Kru Tom Trutnau and has even spent time training in Thailand.  He has almost 12 years of training jiu jitsu and muay thai, 8 years as a professional fighter and about 7 years training other professional fighters and grapplers from beginning to high level athletes.  It is the objective of Hybrid Martial Arts LLC to introduce the art and sport of a variety of mixed martial arts to the Monticello and surrounding communities. Our primary focus will be to educate, train, and celebrate the arts of jiu jitsu and muay thai.

They will learn that Commitment, Respect, Focus, Self-Discipline and effort always make a rewarding experience and bring positive results. Besides self defense skills that will give children a high degree of self confidence. Our Kids and Juniors programs will also work on: Developing listening, obedience and focusing skills; Improving social skills; Improving self-control, respect and discipline; Increasing physical attributes such as hand-eye coordination, strength, agility and flexibility. What makes Gracie Jiu-Jitsu so effective for kids is the fact that instead of learning moves through katas or prearranged set of movements carried out on a cooperative training partner, they will learn how to apply grappling techniques on a resisting training partner who's not cooperating and is counteracting with his own moves, much like as what you'd see on the streets.";;;;;"http://www.graciehumaitacolumbia.com/#Schedule";;"Shawn Woods";;"graciecolumbia@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/graciecolumbia/";;;;1;;

Using our proven techniques your child will be able to defend themselves from bullies even though we do not teach them how to strike. Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is a fantastic way to promote an active and healthy lifestyle for kids of any ages. Parents of our students often find that their children gain self-esteem through athletic achievement and learn how to carry themselves better in situations that require them to deal with pressure. If your son or daughter is acting overly aggressive in school, lacks focus and or discipline then we at Gracie Columbia recommend you start them out with a private lesson to introduce them to the sport and class structure. They will learn that Commitment, Respect, Focus, Self-Discipline and effort always make a rewarding experience and bring positive results. Besides self defense skills that will give children a high degree of self confidence. Our Kids and Juniors programs will also work on: Developing listening, obedience and focusing skills; Improving social skills;  Improving self-control, respect and discipline; Increasing physical attributes such as hand-eye coordination, strength, agility and flexibility. What makes Gracie Jiu-Jitsu so effective for kids is the fact that instead of learning moves through katas or prearranged set of movements carried out on a cooperative training partner, they will learn how to apply grappling techniques on a resisting training partner who's not cooperating and is counteracting with his own moves, much like as what you'd see on the streets.";;;;;"http://graciesemo.com/#Schedule";;"Brian Imholz";;"capebjj@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GracieSemo/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCqBG6kile7rqJUl9hlOYXQ";"https://youtu.be/BL-taxLM5fM";;1;;

All the Gracie were slight of frame, but Helio was particularly small and frail. Because of his small stature, Helio could not use many of the Japanese moves that were based on power and speed, so he developed new leverages and new ways of doing moves. Helio turned out to be a brilliant innovator, and the style he developed proved to be victorious against all others, regardless of size. For the next seventy-five years the Gracie family dedicated themselves to the preservation and dissemination of this great fighting style - Gracie Jiu Jitsu. Our owner and head instructor Professor JW Wright has been training with Helio's son, Master Royler Gracie and Master David Adiv since 1999. He earned his black belt in 2008 and has been teaching the art of Gracie Jiujitsu in this area since 2002. His passion for teaching good people great jiujitsu is demonstrated across the nation in his seminars and lessons on self defense, training of law enforcement, and the many Pan American and World Champions who have trained with him through the years.

We work our hardest every day to fulfill those things, and give our students the best experience we possibly can. Here's what it takes, and what you can expect when you walk through our doors for the first time:  Knowledgeable, Passionate Instructors. When hand-picking our instructors, we look for a few key traits: passion for martial arts, passion for teaching, a great personality, and expertise. Our instructors truly care about you and your experience. They're here for every question you have and every challenge that arises. They'll push you to try your hardest, and motivate you to surpass your limits. Nothing beats having a great teacher - and we have the best.  A Clean, Up-to-Date Facility. The best teachers in the world won't make up for a dirty facility with run-down equipment. That's why, every day, we thoroughly clean our studio from top to bottom. And we check our equipment to make sure it's in good working order, and replace it when it needs replacing. Community. Finally, it takes the right people to make an amazing community. The environment of our school attracts people who are open-minded, enjoy socializing with one another, and enjoy having fun. The parents whose kids train with us are caring and supportive. The adults who train with us are kind and fun. It's like a family here, and we'd love for you to become a part of it.";"http://www.hahnmma.com/images/pages/logo.png";"http://www.hahnmma.com/classes.php";"Whether or not your child is athletic, they'll feel right at home in our Festus Kids Martial Arts classes. That's because every child here is encouraged to go at his own pace. That's one of the reasons lots of kids prefer martial arts over team sports.There's no competition. Just encouragement, growth and development. Kids learn focus, respect, goal setting and more. And martial arts is a full body workout too - helping kids get fit & healthy.

All our classes are taught by actual fighters who have an abundance of skills and knowledge. We provide mixed-martial arts, kickboxing, boxing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, and strength and conditioning classes. We also provide kids classes, womens classes, and coed classes that focus on these disciplines.";"http://finneyskickboxing.com/images/weblogo.png";"http://finneyskickboxing.com/kids-mma-classes-youth-mma-classes-finneys/";"At Finney’s MMA, where we teach the disciplines of Mixed Martial Arts, kickboxing, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, fun and learning go together like a one-two combo. We help the kids develop confidence, to become aware of what they can do and meet their potential in our MMA, Jiu-Jitsu, and Judo classes. This confidence will help to build strength, endurance, flexibility, balance, and coordination. There are other benefits as well-not just physical. Along with being a well-known training facility for teens and adults, Finney’s MMA prides itself on our Mini-Finney program available to boys and girls, ages 4-13 years, regardless of prior experience. Our Mini-Finney program develops physical fitness while instilling a sense of self-worth as the kids learn new skills in a fun and safe environment. A child faces new challenges every day: time-management, homework, good-manners, and even bullies. Our Mini-Finney’s program is an excellent way for children to learn valuable tools to help handle life’s many challenges–all while having a great time! We focus on building attitude, discipline, and respect in our students so they have an advantage not only when it comes to martial arts but everyday life. Mini-Finney’s is 5 days a week, 45 minutes per class, and is designed to teach children self-defense, self-confidence, responsibility, and the value of hard work in a safe atmosphere which is organized and run by professionals. Martial arts can positively impact kids by improving their life-skills and placing emphasis on their values and attitudes. They learn to focus, which can eventually improve study habits, listening skills, and ability to follow direction, which can all lead to better performance in school. Focused kids have an easier time setting and achieving goals, which can then carry on throughout their lives. Our classes are a positive way for children to release stress, learn the importance of physical fitness, and feel accomplishment after earning achievement. We have several strategies to teach the value of setting goals, working toward them, and fulfilling them: Our students can witness the results of hard work first hand as they improve at the techniques they’ve learned through attentive listening and practice. Our Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program offers belt advancement based on technique and character. Our students often compete in grappling competitions and kickboxing exhibitions, where they learn the thrill of competition as their team and coaches cheer them on. A skilled martial artist is a result of years of dedication, practice, effective learning, and a positive, respectful attitude. Our students learn these lessons while having a great time working toward a goal.";"http://finneyskickboxing.com/all-womens-classes/";"At Finney’s MMA, our all-womens’ classes are focused on burning calories and getting members in amazing shape while teaching real-world, functional self-defense techniques.

The fearful is usually the victim and the insecure is usually the aggressor that seeks confrontation to hide their own feeling of weakness. The gentle art will teach kids to defend themselves when necessary and help them deal with fear. At the same time, it will address insecurity and help that aggressive kid to be more confident, polite and respectful. There’s no room for prejudice on the mat. As you have to actually prove yourself against all sorts of people, you quickly realize that we are all equal in our shortcomings and potentials. The difference lies on how much work we put in to neutralize one and boost the other. This notion will most likely accompany the child outside the academy as well. A bully is a coward. He or she identifies those who lack self-confidence and prey on it. Jiu Jitsu gives kids the self-confidence to stand up for themselves at the moment of the first approach, usually a verbal one. Once you know that you can defend yourself, you will let the bully know right away and they will usually back off.";;;"Youn Wha Ryu, Tai Chi, Yoga";;;;;;;"https://www.facebook.com/farmingtonmartialarts/";;;;1;;
