Modern Vee Jitsu is the classical style of Vee Jitsu that was taught exclusively by Supreme Grand Master Florendo Visitacion in the 1950’s. The Modern Vee Jitsu fighting system has both an external and internal component. The external component conditions the body, develops physical power and takes the outward manifestations of strength. The internal component develops inward body functions (such as breathing), intuitive response, concentration and strength of will. In combination these two components form the yielding and flowing style of Modern Vee Jitsu. This fighting style is the progenitor of all the fighting systems developed by Supreme Grand Master Florendo Visitacion.";"http://www.mvjathletics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/MVJA-HEADER2.jpg";"http://www.mvjathletics.com/kids-programs/";"Wouldn’t you like your child to develop amazing self-discipline, a positive attitude, and an unstoppable “can-do” level of confidence?

We are committed to preserving the technical and philosophical roots of jūjutsu (jiu-jitsu) as imparted to us by Grandmasters Helio Gracie and Dr. Pedro Valente Sr.";"https://valentebrothers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Valente_Brothers_Logo.png";"https://valentebrothers.com/youth-program/";"Every day in the United States, an estimated 150,000 kids miss school due to fear or intimidation of bullies. In fact, many believe that fear of bullying may be the leading cause of low self-confidence in children. Worse, statistics suggest that less than 15% of kids actually report acts of bullying. We know that most bullies are insecure and seek self-esteem normally by harassing smaller or weaker children. These negative experiences often create psychological trauma that might last a lifetime. The Valente Brothers Youth Program focuses on the physical, emotional and mental well being, as well as the education of our children. It is “Education for Life.” Firstly, we provide our young students with the most powerful defensive skills so they will be prepared to confidently stand up against bullies. In addition, we assist our students with the development of characteristics and skills they will need in order to live a happy and balanced life. Our young pupils develop discipline, respect, courage, athleticism, and patience among other important values. We promote nonviolent resolutions to conflict. The Valente Brothers Youth Program focuses a great deal of attention to the development of self-esteem.  A good self-image is the basis of a well functioning, happy and successful child. Our curriculum integrates physical education and self-defense techniques with conditioning and skill oriented games aimed at improving your child’s coordination, motor skills, agility and flexibility. Every instructor receives training in our unique teaching methodology, enabling them to deliver learning through dynamic interaction with the children, using a variety of approaches that meet the various learning types of individual children, whether visual, kinesthetic or auditory. ";"https://valentebrothers.com/womens-program/";"The Valente Brothers Womens’ program was specifically designed to prepare women for real life threatening situations. Our Self Defense techniques provide the knowledge and skills for any woman to escape from her attacker, whether she is on her feet or on the ground. This course is unique because it does not rely exclusively on punching and kicking, as do many other forms of martial arts. Punching and kicking do not represent an effective strategy against an assailant who is bigger, stronger and capable of hitting back. In addition, they are useless on the ground, which is where a rapist/attacker is most likely to assault a woman. In addition to empowering women through the most effective self-defense techniques, the regular practice of Jiu-Jitsu represents one of the most complete forms of exercise. Students quickly notice an increase in flexibility, muscle strength, endurance and general well being.";"Fighting Foundations™, Fighting Mastery™, Military, Law Enforcement";;"https://valentebrothers.com/coral-gables/";;"James Robertson, Burak Eyilik";"Free Introductory classes are only available to Miami-Dade and Broward County residents.

"De La Riva BJJ";"https://www.delarivabjjfl.com/";(727) 277-7027;"11128 Libby Road";"Spring Hill";"FL";34609;;"United States";"The De La Riva Guard is a quite recent jiu-jitsu technique, created during the 80’s, by our master Ricardo De La Riva. Of the jiu-jitsu techniques that involve the names of athletes - “Kimura”, “Ezequiel” and “De La Riva” – this is the only one that is named after a jiu-jitsu athlete and is the only one of the three that actually arose from the evolution of jiu-jitsu, considering that Kimura and Ezequiel were judokas and the techniques that are named after them are ancient Judo techniques ( “Kimura” is known in judo as ""Ude Garami"", and “Ezequiel” is known in judo as ""Sode Guruma Jime""). Master Ricardo De La Riva started training BJJ in 1980, having been awarded his black belt from the hands of master Carlson Gracie in 1986. He presented excellent performance in competitions, having beaten various Jiu-jitsu legends that were, until then, unbeatable in certain competitions. His most notable performance was during the Copa Cantão Championship, in the middle of 1986.  Additionally, he also trained and helped train great BJJ and MMA athletes. At the time of its appearance, the guard style most used in jiu-jitsu was the “Closed Guard”. Having a smaller physique than that of his training colleagues, de la Riva was practically forced to train using the Open Guard technique. It was during the use of this guarding technique (when he  was still a brown belt) that he realized that he was successfully unbalancing many of his training partners, particularly when he used his feet as a hook (this technique arose due to, in his own words, his instinct of survival). Having understood the potential of his discovery, De La Riva put his creativity to work. Since he was already training at the academy with some of the best guard passers in the world, this was the perfect laboratory to conduct tests. It was then that his partners started calling the position “Guarda Pudim” (Pudding Guard”), due to the instability that it caused to the passers balance, making them wobble like a pudding. The title that called the attention of Jiu-Jitsu followers to De La Riva was, coincidentally, the same that brought acknowledgement to his new guard: the 1986 Copa Cantão Championship in which he participated as an underdog and ended up being proclaimed champion. Few believed that De La Riva had any chance of beating the undisputed favorite but he proved that he was worthy of the challenge and, taking utmost advantage of his referenced hook, won the fight after the referee’s decision. The fight received a lot of coverage from the jiu-jitsu specialized media which used the term “De La Riva Guard” to describe this new position. Since its first appearance, the De La Riva Guard has not stopped evolving. It is adopted by many world champions and has become one of the most taught jiu-jitsu techniques. It is a position that has extrapolated its original format, having today various different developments, inversions and adjustments.";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b9f8e4_8fbf51828f9e4a728e732557c9c31f8b~mv2_d_2013_2022_s_2.gif";;;;;"Muay Thai, Wrestling, MMA, Yoga";;;;"Iury Debs";;"info@delarivabjjfl.com";"https://www.facebook.com/delarivabjj";;;;1;428;

The confidence they obtain while learning BJJ ultimately helps them perform better in academics, become more outgoing in social settings, and set higher goals for their future. Most importantly, they have fun with great instructors and friends. There are many martial arts to choose from, but in our opinion, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is the most effective and best suited for a child to learn. BJJ techniques are based on leverage and technique. It is a system designed to help a smaller person defeat a larger opponent, which makes it a perfect fit for kids. Our youth students learn how to stay calm in hostile situations. We first teach them to avoid a confrontation if at all possible. But if it isn't, they will know how to engage an opponent, control the situation, and create an opportunity to end a fight without permanent damage to themselves or their opponent.

";;"http://velocitymartialarts.com/kids-martial-arts-classes/";"Kids Brazilian Jiu jitsu classes are an art form with a long and rich history, from its earliest mentions in the Samurai era, to its development as a unique and distinct art of grappling-oriented techniques. This history progresses further with the Judo distillation under Jigoro Kano, and yet still further by the Brazilian Jiu-jitsu or Gracie Jiu-jitsu revolution of the modern age. The arena of MMA or the Mixed Martial Arts, has demonstrated clearly the importance of an integrated approach to one’s Martial Arts training regimen. The Brazilian Top Team, and its U.S. counterpart, American Top Team, were the first Brazilian-based Jiu-jitsu fighters to truly complete their technique by seeking to join forces with experts in boxing and wrestling in order to unify the seemingly disparate combative methods. The fact that these sorts of maneuvers do not rely on strength and size but rather technique and leverage makes Brazilian Jiu jitsu a viable self-defense system for kids martial arts classes. With the fitness and even obesity issues that are so common in this country today, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Submission Wrestling stands as an excellent exercise choice for today’s child.

And while that was not truly the case, these arts were definitely a predominantly male activity. Beginning in the 1980's, the Martial Arts industry became modernized, and at the same time a great number of Martial Arts gyms and schools began to increase their level of professionalism to match their already high level of technical quality. The immediate result was that schools around the country and elsewhere saw an explosive increase of women among their ranks. Since then, many Martial Arts programs have both men and women in equal numbers, and there are many cases where women are dominant gender. The need of some variety of self-defense training for today's woman is a basic and apparent facet of martial culture, less obvious may be the fitness and wellness capacity of these arts. The Martial Arts are also a fascinating and profound realm of human possibility, empowering a person to ascend beyond ordinary human limitation.";"Mixed Martial Arts, Boxing, Taekwondo, Capoeira, Kickboxing, Yoga, After School Program, Seasonal Camps";;"http://velocitymartialarts.com/schedule/lauderhill-class-schedule/";;"Charles Panoyan";;;;"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1Cq2brvpRsND-kCh8npUA";"https://youtu.be/yyJdU2am8dM";;0;479;

"Carlson Gracie Jiu Jitsu Miami";"http://www.buiubjj.com/";(305) 386-4103;"4033 SW 152nd Ave";"Miami";"FL";33185;;"United States";"Carlson Gracie Miami Brazilian Jiu jitsu & MMA academy was founded and opened in June of 2008. It began with four students under the instruction of a world renowned, highly revered and respected doctor of the art, Fourth degree Professor Master Michel ""Buiu"" Porfirio Pereira; with two and a half decades of experience and knowledge in the most effective self defense system known to man. Under the direct lineage of the Carlson Gracie legacy, within one generation of the Gracie family legacy, the academy is a member of the Carlson Gracie Federation which stretches around the world from continent to continent. Master Michel ""Buiu"" Porfirio Pereira is one out of five men certified under the American Brazilian Jiu jitsu Federation to teach under this prestigious lineage here in the United States. He is also a vital member of the IBJJF, the International Brazilian Jiu jitsu Federation. This is the federation that is responsible for the entire International world Championships of Brazilian Jiu jitsu and is owned by the Gracie family. It acts as the worldwide government of Brazilian Jiu jitsu regulating the art and distinguishing the real from the fake. Before Master Michel ""Buiu"" Porfirio Pereira came to Florida there were no IBJJF tournaments in this state. In 2009 Master Michel ""Buiu"" Porfirio Pereira was the instrument in bringing and organizing one of the biggest international tournaments in the entire world here to South Florida. A tournament where the best fighters from all over the entire world meet to compete against each other. Master Michel ""Buiu"" Porfirio Pereira was prestigiously awarded for his accomplishments by the Gracie Family in a ceremony of honor and recognition; he was given an award for ""The expansion of Brazilian Jiu jitsu in South Florida"". Within a short span of 4 1/2 years, this academy he started in 2008 quickly outgrew its location and is now if not the largest, one of largest academies in the South Eastern Region of the United States. This phenomenal growth can be attributed to many reasons: He is only one out of four Professors in Miami certified by the IBJJF. His program is a classic style martial arts system which incorporates positive philosophies, lifestyle altering teaching methods which transform lives and character. The lessons learned on the mats go far beyond fighting, into the realm of personal improvement, upholding the traditional ""Bushido"" also known as the code of the warrior. According to these teachings, there are seven characteristics of a warrior, none of which have anything to do with fighting or violence: Bushido- the way of the warrior, Gi- Integrity, Rei- Respect, Yu- Moral Courage, Meyo- Honor, Jin- Compassion, Makoto- Honesty & Sincerity, Chu- Duty & Loyalty. There are many other reasons why Carlson Gracie Miami has become what it is now. But to summarize, a dojo is a reflection of its leader. And our leader leads us selflessly, in humility, always willing to give the shirt off of his back to help a student. With no ego, upholding the dignity of all, never will you hear him speak negatively of anyone no matter what the circumstance may be. Forgiveness, mercy, and love is the way he walks, always looking for someone to help, therefore this academy reflects these attributes. Jiu jitsu is a tool that we use to change, transform, improve, and unify people and families. This school is a family, and water can be thicker than blood. ""I would rather have one student that changed his lifestyle and heart through Jiu jitsu, then five hundred champion fighters""......

At Vagner Rocha Martial Arts, our mission is not only to instruct women of all ages to be aware of dangerous situations, but also provide our students with practical self-defense techniques, proven to be effective in real world-situations. Our women’s self-defense curriculum is based in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, which is largely considered to be the best and most viable form of self-defense available. With Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at its core, our women’s program is focused on the unique dangers and challenges faced by women today, and provides our members with the skills and confidence that is necessary to avoid potential harm, as well as to protect themselves against an aggressor. Our Women’s Self Defense program aims to teach women how to defend themselves from a different perspective. Women will learn how to defend themselves standing up (which is usually how an attack starts), and they also learn how to defend themselves on the ground (which is usually where an attack ends). Even our head instructor, black belt Vagner Rocha, places his trust in the effectiveness of our women’s self-defense program and ensures that both his wife and daughter are trained in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Boxing self-defense for their own personal safety. As such, we encourage women of all ages to try our classes.

I won't bore you with which ""styles"" and that kind of stuff. What's important is that it works! Simply put, these are principles and techniques that make sure you are the one going home to your loved ones at the end of the day. It teaches kids awareness to recognise a potentially bad situation and how to avoid it. And should they find themselves in a bad situation, they'll have the techniques and knowledge to defend themselves. Not only that, but this Self-Defense system is easy to learn. That means no prior martial arts training is needed. It's been taught to police officers, the military, teachers, doctors, athletes and non-athletes. This is NOT for people looking to ""beat up"" people. This is not a fight club or a gym. This is a school with certified instructors. It's all done in a safe, respectful and positive atmosphere. Everyone in class wants you to succeed and to get better. When your training partners are skilled they help you get better. Plus, it's a great way to get in shape! It improves coordination, teaches respect and discipline, improves school grades and gives confidence.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is not easy. It is widely accepted that it is, in fact, the most difficult Martial Art. We challenge each of our children to put in real effort. To push themselves to be the best they can be BOTH on and off the mats. We are heavily involved with the parents and encourage updates on behavior and grades at school. We keep an open line of communication so that we can be a resource for your family. We consider it our HIGHEST Honor that you allow us to teach your children this amazing art. Key lines of instruction, in addition to learning legitimate self defense techniques, include an anti bullying program. From time to time we will discuss Verbal and Non-Verbal communication skills to show your child how to carry themselves in a manner, that avoids conflict. But if conflict should find them.. they are prepared. We also encourage the defense of others to instill a high level of integrity. In short- bullying is never acceptable. We encourage our students to “Speak up” or “Step up” to defend others against such behavior.

Not only is jiu jitsu the most effective form of self-defense for kids, but BJJ promotes confidence, discipline, respect, and many other developmental qualities. Most other martial arts involve striking. Do you really want your child throwing up their fists as a defense to a larger and stronger child? What happens when the fight goes to the ground? If your child trains jiu jitsu, it’s like being a shark in the water when others can’t even swim. Placing children into a safe, clean, and positive Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu environment fosters confidence in a child – confidence that translates well off the mats, regardless of athleticism. Because of the practicality of jiu jitsu, the confidence gained by your child is not a false one. Many martial arts incorporate choreographed “forms” or board breaking. While these aspects may be fun and great for photo-ops, they just don’t carry over into real life scenarios. A false sense of confidence for a child who has been practicing how to block a pool noodle is not a good thing. Today, we see a lot of bullying in schools. Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu allows the child to work from the ground and gain dominance – even over much larger and stronger opponents.

If you are reading this and your child has broken a thing or two around the house whilst jumping off of furniture or barreling down the stairs, it may be time to channel this seemingly unlimited energy into something that won’t cause undue harm to the persons and belongings in your home. For your hyper-active little, a martial arts class may be just the thing to focus that energy into something less destructive. Here at the American Top Team St. Pete martial arts for kids program, we can do just that. Our kids martial arts classes in St. Petersburg, FL teach techniques from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and are a fun way for girls and boys alike to drain their abundant energy and they offer other benefits that may surprise you. While there are some parents that may believe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu promotes violent behavior, but that is far from the truth. The martial arts, in addition to building physical strength and improving coordination, can help teach self-discipline and socialization skills, among other areas. It has been shown to also aid children have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Our St. Pete martial arts kids’ programs fosters self-control and concentration – this is great for all children but especially so in kids whose skills in these areas are underdeveloped due to ADHD. What does our St. Pete martial arts kids program look like? A typical class begins and ends with a bow to the teacher. After a warm-up, students practice different elements of brazilian jiu-jitsu, including kicks, punches and blocks. Each requires concentration and strict attention, while the interaction with their teacher builds respect. Progress in brazilian jiu-jitsu, like most martial arts, is marked by the belt system. The beginner goes from their first white belt through a series of other colored belts until reaching the infamous black belt status. While getting to each new level in itself is a great source of exercise for the children, it the respect the kids learn along the way that is one of the most important benefits. This benefit can lead to improved behavior, both at home and at school.";;;"Cardio Kickboxing, MMA, Muay Thai, Submission Grappling";;"https://attstpete.com/schedule/";"Mon-Fri: 9:00am-10:00pm; Sat: 9:00am-6:00pm";"Junior Fernandes";"We offer One-Week Trials to all local St. Pete and Tampa Bay area residents that are looking to begin their Mixed Martial Arts & Fitness journey.

Rilion has instructed members of the U.S. Armed Forces, law enforcement officers, air marshals, security professionals, as well as private citizens. Students come from all around the world to train and improve their skills at our academy. Jiu Jitsu, however, is for everyone, regardless of age, gender, body type or physical ability. By using leverage, balance and technique, a weaker individual can defend themselves against stronger, more physically capable opponents.";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8667fc_0cceb8ec45574a71b878b34e98ee9238~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_77,h_54,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/8667fc_0cceb8ec45574a71b878b34e98ee9238~mv2.png";"https://www.rgacrestview.com/kids-juniors";"Would you like to see your children to be confident, healthy, and respectful with a lifelong love of learning? Our Kids and Juniors Program takes a two-fold approach to developing skills for children: Martial Arts and Personal Development. Gracie Jiu Jitsu will develop an emotional balance that is a important key to inner peace, harmony, leadership, responsibility, courage and other important moral values. The Program gives your child the self control and ability to handle life’s threatening situations while building a strong foundation of self confidence. This conscience will enable your kids to develop a calmer and more tolerant disposition to be able to interact with other kids. Because Gracie Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu uses the entire body to perform techniques, children build valuable motor skills and are confident in their ability. Each class consists of physical exercises, self defense techniques and educational games. Our method will develop your child’s coordination, agility and flexibility in a fun and safe environment. We also put an emphasis on the personal development of our Youths - on the mat and off. We encourage the values of honesty, integrity, and good citizenship while focusing on self-confidence, goal setting and achievement, and using good judgment.";;;;;;;;;"info@rgacrestview.com";"https://www.facebook.com/rgacrestview";;;;1;;

We teach our kids to have proper restraint in using their skills and to respect everybody. But, when it comes competition time or self-defense time, we train our kids to get the take down, mount their opponent, and control the fight. And just in case something goes wrong, we teach our kids how to survive attacks and transition to a superior position as soon as possible. Our Kids Jiu-Jitsu program draws from the disciplines of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Wrestling, to teach your kids techniques to defend themselves and compete in any of those disciplines. We deliberately use a team coaching approach, with both male and female coaches on our team from different backgrounds. We believe in the value of a program that lets our students successfully compete in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitions, Judo competitions, and Wrestling tournaments because competition drives excellence. But, we also believe that a program that emphasizes respect, conditioning, and character development is just as important as a solid technical program.

Children that learn martial arts develop the confidence to know that if they are ever bullied, they have the skills they need to defend themselves. However, the real skill we teach is diffusing situations with words before they ever escalate to a physical level. Martial arts help teach self-discipline and socialization skills. In fact, many parents whose children have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report great success with these programs because self-control and concentration are commonly underdeveloped skills in ADHD kids. Perhaps most importantly, students learn that physical activity is a healthy way to have fun. With health problems such as diabetes and obesity affecting more and more young people, parents should take steps to help their children avoid these issues.

In many of these schools the primary training method is solo, prearranged forms performed in the air. This alone prepares your child for a real assault only a little better than a ballet class. Breaking boards and kicking the air is cool looking, but boards don’t hit back. The alternative to this lack of realism is to have children sparring with full force which includes strikes to the head. Since this is a bad idea for children, it leads to these martial arts to developing a mystic aura when it pertains to applicable self defense skills. Nothing is mystical about martial arts. Its one of the most honest forms of expression and something that appeals to Jiu-Jitsu practitioners of all ages. Something either works, or it doesn’t. The truth is found and tested every day on the mat. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) differs from Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Kung Fu and other martial arts because of its focus on grappling, instead of punches and kicks. Our program teaches children basic striking techniques, but we also ensure that each child learns what to do on the ground by practicing takedowns, sweeps, escapes, reversals, submissions and self-defense. Since these techniques rely on leverage and not size or strength (unlike martial arts that focus on punching and kicking) a Jiu-Jitsu practitioner is able to defeat much larger and stronger opponents. This coupled with the fact that most fights - including confrontations with bullies - end up on the ground, makes Jiu-Jitsu the most effective martial art for children.";;;"MMA, Muay Thai, Submission Grappling, Fitness Programs";;"http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/3c1651_6dd108dd323f43a9a790ae6aed6f6bfb.pdf";;"Paul Rodriguez";"Free Trial Class";;;"https://www.youtube.com/user/ATTOrlando/";"https://youtu.be/rbnwqpqSHzg";;1;;

This history progresses further with the Judo distillation under Jigoro Kano, and yet still further by the Brazilian Jiu-jitsu or Gracie Jiu-jitsu revolution of the modern age. The arena of MMA or the Mixed Martial Arts, has demonstrated clearly the importance of an integrated approach to one’s Martial Arts training regimen. The Brazilian Top Team, and its U.S. counterpart, American Top Team, were the first Brazilian-based Jiu-jitsu fighters to truly complete their technique by seeking to join forces with experts in boxing and wrestling in order to unify the seemingly disparate combative methods. The fact that these sorts of maneuvers do not rely on strength and size but rather technique and leverage makes Brazilian Jiu jitsu a viable self-defense system for kids martial arts classes. With the fitness and even obesity issues that are so common in this country today, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Submission Wrestling stands as an excellent exercise choice for today’s child. Stop by our gym for a free class if you are interested in trying kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Classes. ";"http://velocitymartialarts.com/womens-martial-arts-programs/";"In times past, the Martial Arts were a thing usually generalized as a male-oriented pursuit. And while that was not truly the case, these arts were definitely a predominantly male activity. Beginning in the 1980's, the Martial Arts industry became modernized, and at the same time a great number of Martial Arts gyms and schools began to increase their level of professionalism to match their already high level of technical quality. The immediate result was that schools around the country and elsewhere saw an explosive increase of women among their ranks. Since then, many Martial Arts programs have both men and women in equal numbers, and there are many cases where women are dominant gender. The need of some variety of self-defense training for today's woman is a basic and apparent facet of martial culture, less obvious may be the fitness and wellness capacity of these arts. The Martial Arts are also a fascinating and profound realm of human possibility, empowering a person to ascend beyond ordinary human limitation.";"Mixed Martial Arts, Boxing, Taekwondo, Capoeira, Kickboxing, Yoga, After School Program, Seasonal Camps";;"http://velocitymartialarts.com/schedule/pompano-beach-class-schedule/";;"Charles Panoyan";;;;"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1Cq2brvpRsND-kCh8npUA";"https://youtu.be/yyJdU2am8dM";;0;;

We make it our mission for everybody who comes in, no matter what age or size, to find like-minded practitioners ready to take their self defense, physical fitness, and enjoyment of the art to the next level.

It teaches that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique—most notably by applying joint locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu can be trained for sport grappling tournaments and mixed martial arts ( MMA ) competition or self defense. The classes are separated by age and belt level.";;;"MMA";;"https://renzogracielakeworth.com/schedule/";"Mon, Wed: 9:00am-8:30pm; Tues: 6:30am-8:30pm; Thurs: 6:30am-9:00pm; Fri: 9:00am-8:30pm; Sat: 9:00am-11:30am; Sun: 10:00am-11:00am";"Stan Beck";" Free For One Month";"info@renzogracielakeworth.com";"https://www.facebook.com/renzogracielakeworth/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC73R2fmsbMR5H1Vq4QD8Ogg";"https://youtu.be/9JlB4h5gpvo";;0;;
