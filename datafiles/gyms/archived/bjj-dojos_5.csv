This philosophy, developed by chief instructor Sensei Toru Shimoji, is best explained in an examination of the translation of the three Japanese words combined in the name.  If you separate the Japanese kanji characters that make up the word Jinsendo, its underlying meaning is brought to light. The first one “jin” (root pronunciation “hito”) is literally translated as person, or human race.  ""Sen"""", the second character implies line, path or projection. The last kanji “do” (root pronunciation “michi"") means path, road or “the way of”. Putting them all together, “people line way”, is the literal translation. However, all of the above can be further expressed as, “The way of actualizing human potential”.  Jinsendo is the projection of human spirit to continually evolve with others in a like-minded endeavor that adheres to three guiding principles: honor the spirit of free will; rise above confrontational energy; seek cooperation through mutual engagement.";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fdc45e_fa398f8bdb58443cbca4607dc2f223f5~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_207,h_58,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/Jinsendo_horz_logo.webp";"https://www.karateatl.com/yoji-preschool-karate";"Jinsendo's Preschool Karate Program in Atlanta helps children excel in a variety of key developmental areas.

This class helps a child develop self confidence and self awareness so that they can start learning how to participate in a group setting with other kids.  We play games that will train their muscle memory  to do Jiu-Jitsu as they get older.  The kids also learn how to focus and participate as a group.  They learn the value of matching up and that losing has value as much as winning.  The kids train with each other and parents are encouraged to participate in any of the games and activities. Kids & Big Kids (ages 4 - 5 and ages 6 - 8) - This class is designed to help kids learn how to protect themselves from bullies or anyone else who wants to hurt them.  It is also a pre-curser class to Jiu Jitsu.  What makes this class so unique is that the parents are welcome to participate with the child.  Each class is created so that the parent can do the program with the child so that the child may practice the techniques at home as well as in class allowing them to build confidence and muscle memory so that the techniques come to them naturally and instinctively.  If a parent is not available to participate with the child, that is OK too. There is no better gift to give your child, and yourself, then knowing that your child can defend their self against someone bigger and stronger in a threatening situation.  It not only gives you peace of mind, but your child as well. Pre-Teen (ages 9 -11) - Pre-Teens are on the verge of transitioning out of childhood and enter into the teenage years. This is the class where kids have to step up to the plate and focus on their goals in Jiu Jitsu and start thinking and producing more maturely.  Kids will learn to think in combinations and prevention.  This class is a precursor to the Teen Class. Teens (ages 12 - 16) - KJJ has one of the largest ""Teen"" programs in Hawaii.  They not only learn the art of Jiu Jitsu for self defense, sport and competition, but when they qualify, are trained to be assistant instructors to the Kid's classes which increases their own training exponentially.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, or BJJ, is a self defense system that focuses on grappling or ground fighting. The art was derived from the Japanese martial art of Kodokan Judo in the early 20th century. It teaches that a smaller, and sometimes weaker, person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by utilizing proper technique and leverage. The most common ways to defeat a bigger opponent is through joint locks or chokeholds. Mitsuyo Maeda began to travel the world in 1904 doing Judo demonstrations and challenging Boxers, wrestlers and other martial artists to fights. He arrived in Brazil November 14, 1914. In Brazil, in the northern state of Para, he befriended Gastão Gracie, an influential businessman, who helped Maeda get established. To show his gratitude, Maeda offered to teach Judo to Gastão’s oldest son, Carlos Gracie. Carlos learned for a few years and eventually passed his knowledge to his brothers. One day, when Helio Gracie was 16 years old, a student showed up for class when Carlos was not around. Helio, who had memorized all the techniques from watching his brothers teach, offered to start the class. When the class was over, Carlos showed up and apologized for his delay. The student asked for Helio to continue being his instructor, Helio Gracie then gradually developed Gracie Jiu Jitsu as an adaptation from Judo as he was unable to do many Judo moves. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu become one of the most famous forms of martial arts in 1994 when the Gracie Family started the Ultimate Fighting Championship.";"http://www.jiujitsuhonolulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BearJitsu-Logo.png";;;;;;;"http://www.jiujitsuhonolulu.com/class-schedule/";;;"Free Class";;"https://www.facebook.com/HMCJiuJitsuHonolulu/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC65J3rv8Hit6gQRoS9t2zfw";"https://youtu.be/Dsy_OQL1LVU";;1;550;

We provide an optimal ""art"" and soul martial arts environment for men, women and children with our first focus on traditional approaches to training based on time tested methods. Our bestpractice and philosophy are antithetical to the current commercialization of martial arts: we are a first in class martial-artist studio dedicated to the art of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu in its purity and entirety.

We train students to pursue mastery through deliberate practice and dedication for internal rewards rather than using external validation through easy badges or belt colors. We adhere to the notion that the ever increasing number of belt ranks in the Jiu-Jitsu community reinforces an instant gratification mindset that is prevalent in today’s “now” and “more is more” culture. At RSA we teach children Gracie Jiu-Jitsu in its purest form and practice with a focus on developing character and perseverance. Our mission is to instill within students the confidence and fortitude that arises from within themselves through hard work, patience and discipline. Because we use these standards and format, admittedly, some students quit before ever really understanding the art and the unforeseen abilities they could one day possess. Members of our kid’s program have the opportunity to grow in confidence, self-mastery and a solid understanding of basic technique and principles necessary for Jiu-Jitsu mastery. However, along with our teaching staff, parents are a vital part of the equation: nudging their child through the discouraging times or as author Seth Godin calls it, “the dip,” that window of hardship which precedes advancement or a change of course to another activity. We’ve seen kids who had very little natural talent, low interest and ability struggle for a long period of time. Yet, after years of dedication and the support of engaged parents, these same individuals have developed into some of the toughest members of our school exhibiting a new sense of self-confidence and excitement at practice which is carried over into their lives outside of class and often result in more positive social interactions at school and at home. Again, there are no short cuts but with the right mindset - in coaches, students and parents - effort is compounded and success inevitably achieved. In short, if you’re looking for a program with a quick rewards system, RSA will not be a good fit. Classes are taught by Fifth Black Belt Ronn Shiraki along with a team of handpicked Assistant Instructors. Widely known as one of Relson Gracie’s top students, Ronn Shiraki has obtained his knowledge directly from the master and passes his training experience to all his students. RSA strives to maintain an intimate class environment while exposing students to all levels of experience and skill. Classes are limited in size as we believe a lower instructor to child ratio is one of the most important parts of a martial-arts program for kids. At RSA we are committed to providing training to all dedicated members regardless of financial background. Help is available for members who are experiencing financial hardship. We do not use contracts or long-term agreements to lock members into paying tuition.";"http://www.ronnshiraki.com/women.html";"Our professional instructors represent integrity and helpfulness in a relaxed class format that ensures a positive and safe learning environment.

The partnership started in a small 2000 square foot building. We had just 400 square feet of mat space, and in order to use them, we had to roll them out every evening after the Crossfit workouts. After 6 short months, The Pack and SIBJJ were able to move, right next door, and we started building up our programs. We doubled our mat space and were able to have more classes. In 2015 we built our current location. The building is over 10,000 sq ft and all dedicated to fitness. We now have over 1600 square feet of top of the line mats, in a climate controlled room.

What we learned is that our martial arts schools’ students come to expect a certain level of service. For this reason, we have built our schools and systems around these promises. Instead of asking our students for long term memberships, we found that when we deliver on these following promises our students get the RESULTS they started for, they can’t wait to attend  each class and simply DON NOT QUIT training (many of our students train and earn their black belt which can take 5-8 years) and they love talking about our martial arts schools to everyone they know.

That is the key benefit to training in the Martial Arts that will lead to so many wonderful things in your child’s life. From making new friends, asking the girl to prom, or walking into their boss’s office to ask for a raise are just some of the situations that your child will eventually find themselves in as they grow up to be teenagers and adults. Having the self-confidence to take action as well as to not take action, is learned on the mats. Let’s talk about bullies. They are everywhere: from the playground to the boardroom.  Training in the Martial Arts doesn’t encourage your child to PHYSICALLY FIGHT the bully, but rather instill the confidence in your child that they DO NOT have to fight.  While your child will be taught the techniques that are designed to keep them safe, they are also being taught to use their voice, rather than their fists to defuse the situation. Having the knowledge that they have the ability to protect themselves and their friends from a bully gives your child more confidence to speak to the bully; to fight fire with water. Many parents are concerned that if they were to enroll their child in a martial arts program that they will become more aggressive and start picking fights.  The opposite is actually true.  When children study the martial arts, through developing self-discipline and learning respect, both for themselves and others, kids become less aggressive and are more likely to talk logically or walk away if confronted with a negative situation.";;;"DDP Yoga";;"https://frequencymartialarts.com/schedule/";;"Ed LeMonnier";"Free Class";"frequencymartialarts@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/FrequencyBJJ";"https://www.youtube.com/c/FrequencymartialartsBJJ";"https://youtu.be/B5Am-0k722Y";;1;594;

"Blind Fury Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu";"https://jiujitsucolumbus.com/";(706) 992-5606;"506 Manchester Expressway, Ste A4";"Columbus";"GA";31904;;"United States";"So what is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu? Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art, sport, and self-defense method from Brazil that evolved from Japanese jiu-jitsu and judo at the turn of the 20th century. Unlike modern sport judo or traditional jiu-jitsu which emphasize stand up locks and throws, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu focuses on the ground game - how to defeat an opponent when the fight goes to the ground. What makes Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu such a formidable self-defense method is its emphasis on training against a resisting partner. While other self-defense methods use cooperative training methods (you do this, I do that - sort of like a dance), in BJJ you train against someone who is resisting your technique in every single class. So, there's no faking skill in BJJ - you either know it, or you don't. And did I happen to mention that jiu-jitsu is a great workout? It's not uncommon for our students to start BJJ classes and lose 10, 20, or 30 pounds or more over the course of their first six months in classes.";"https://jiujitsucolumbus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/columbus-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-logo.jpg";"https://jiujitsucolumbus.com/childrens-martial-arts-classes/";"Are you looking for a positive recreational activity for your child? Would you like your child to develop better focus, improved self-discipline, and increased confidence? Would you also like to make your child ""bully-proof""? Then, you came to the right place! Here at Blind Fury BJJ, your child will learn real self-defense skills from day one, while they also learn valuable life skills to help them succeed in school and life. Along with their jiu-jitsu training, your child will learn character values such as respect, courage, and self-control in our daily mat chats. And what makes Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu great for kids is that instead of emphasizing kicking and punching, the skills in jiu-jitsu are designed to control an opponent with very little violence. Not only will your child learn to protect themselves, they'll also learn ways to defuse confrontations and avoid physical conflict, too. Plus, BJJ is fun for kids! They get to work out all their excess energy on the mat, and we finish every class on a high note with a fun drill or game. Typically parents say it's the one activity they don't have to fight their kids to attend.";;;;;"https://jiujitsucolumbus.com/class-schedule/";;"Jason Keaton";"FREE Ten-Day Introductory Course";;"https://www.facebook.com/jiujitsucolumbus/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd2N4L6YjVasVuTwUCE4l4w";"https://youtu.be/iR5BcOVm8G0";;1;;

Beto went on to win both Silver and Gold medals at the Pan-Americans in 2008 and 2009.

While much is known about Karate for kids, the gentle art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is quickly gaining popularity. Why? Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a ground art, as opposed to standing arts like Karate and Judo. One of the things that make BJJ so great for kids is that it’s low impact. Studies have shown that popular sports like gymnastics, football, and cheerleading can wreak havoc on developing bones and muscular systems. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, while being a contact sport, is much less likely to cause injury to your child. Secondly, the very strategic nature of the sport helps children with mind/body awareness. Children learn to focus, be adaptable, think quickly and plan. In addition to skills learned as individual practitioners, they also learn the importance of teamwork. Our kids train hard in class, but cheer each other on as one in competition. One of the most rewarding aspects of our program is the development of self-discipline. Our young martial artists are responsible for a code of conduct on and off the mats that focuses on respect for others and themselves. We have a lot of fun and at the same time, we help our students understand what an awesome responsibility they have to be good citizens in the world.";"http://worldjiujitsuatlanta.com/women-in-jiu-jitsu";"Yes.

Preparation leads to confidence and confidence leads to success! We train our children to carry themselves with honor and confidence. We teach them the necessary tools to resolve a confrontation with verbal assertiveness, but if the confrontation becomes physical, they are able to control the situation and defend themselves without hurting their attacker. This is one of the main differences between Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and other Martial Arts such as Karate and Tae Kwon Do, the ability to control someone without the use of a single strike. Our curriculum guides them through warm-ups that develop their strength, flexibility and coordination.  They learn effective stand up and ground techniques to defend from the most common bully attacks. Through sparring and drills they develop their reflexes and muscle memory. Children become more FOCUSED, DISCIPLINED, RESPECTFUL and GRATEFUL among other things. This improvement follows them into other facets of life such as school and home.

We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted.

Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus!

It is designed to allow a smaller, weaker person to defend herself in a real world situation even if the encounter goes to the ground. Jiu‐Jitsu does this by the detailed study of correct body mechanics, timing and placement. This class studies self defense against attacks like grabs, bear hugs, chokes and more. Students study takedowns and how to avoid being taken to the ground or pined against a wall. If you end up on the ground you will learn how to escape being held down and get back to your feet. Self-Defense against weapons is also covered, you will learn how to deal with a knife or stick attack. Gracie (Brazilian) Jiu‐Jitsu (BJJ) is a highly effective self‐defense system of ground fighting. It is designed to allow a smaller, weaker person to defend herself in a real world situation that goes to the ground. Gracie Jiu‐Jitsu does this by the detailed study of correct body mechanics, timing and placement. This is good for you the student because the methods are not based one strength or speed so the skills will not fade as will strength and speed. This is also in line with the self‐defense mindset of Gracie Jiu‐Jitsu, meaning your training should prepare you for a street encounter where you don’t get to choose what weight class you will be fighting in. The self defense mindset is important because statistics say 90 to 95% of all violent attacks and street fights end up on the ground, where Gracie Jiu‐Jitsu’s techniques are most effective. Unlike most sport biased Jiu‐Jitsu programs, GJJ not only studies grappling but also teaches the student how to deal with the opponent that tries to strike you in each position and how to effectively deal with it. The physical benefits of training are incredible for the student. Most students experience a physical change in their bodies within 30 days of beginning their training. Students will lose weight and become more lean, gain useable strength, become more flexible and loosen the body. Many students experience lower levels of stress which leads to higher levels of day to day energy. The focus on real‐world self defense is what separates Gracie Jiu‐Jitsu from other Brazilian Jiu‐Jitsu systems that are more sport based. If personal protection and physical fitness are your goals, Gracie Jiu‐Jitsu has an effective answer that will work for you.";"Bruce Lee’s Jeet Kune Do, Warriors Legacy Self Defense, Filipino Martial Arts, Civilian Tactical C-Tac, CSW - No-Gi Grappling, Muay Thai Boxing (Personal Training), Pekiti-Tirsia Kali (Personal Training), Maphilindo Silat (Personal Training), Wing Chun Kung Fu (Personal Training)";;"http://www.atlantamartialartscenter.com/schedule";;"Sifu/Guro Alan Baker";;"amac@atlantamartialartscenter.com";"https://www.facebook.com/atlantamartialarts";"https://www.youtube.com/user/abaker99/";"https://youtu.be/nCja6M9NdrM";;1;;

The statistics show that this will be a uphill battle though;  28% of children report being bullied throughout their middle school and high school experiences. Research shows over half of all bullying can be stopped by the victim verbally asserting themselves, and standing their ground against their aggressor.  However, this is much easier said than done.  A bully chooses it’s target wisely, and will hone in on the children he or she perceives as having low self esteem.  A child’s mind is wired for it’s personal safety first, and many times the psychological fear of physical violence is enough to keep them from standing up for themselves; and that’s where we come in. Learning an *effective* self defense system like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu will empower your child with the confidence needed to stand up for themselves. This does not mean that they will march into the school and try to start a fight with every kid that looks at them funny!  A confident child carries himself in a way that will deter bullies.  With the knowledge that the bully cannot physically harm them, they will hold no psychological edge over your child, and they cease to be a victim. Our kid’s classes use games and concepts found in the award winning Gracie Bully Proof program, which is a great supplement to our in academy training.

In addition to its dynamic forms training, Chinese Boxing focuses on real life application of its techniques through updated training methods and two-person drilling. WEE JIU-JITSU KIDS: This amazing art utilizes leverage and technique, over strength and speed, allowing for a smaller person to take on much larger aggressor. It’s regarded by many as the most effective martial art in the world! Today, Jiu-Jitsu is not only a self-defense art, but also a sport with many tournaments being held in the United States and the world over. Studies suggest that bullying may be the leading cause of low self-esteem in children, and according to some surveys, less than 15% of kids actually report acts of bullying. Children’s inability to stand up to a bully is rooted in profound fear for their personal safety. Ironically, the victims know that they must confront the bully and would like nothing more than to stand up to them. But, they simply can’t follow through for fear of the physical harm that backs the bully’s every action. And, therein lies the challenge – how do you instill in a victim of bullying the confidence to face the tormentor, look them in the eye, and back them down? The answer is simple – teach the victims to defend themselves against physical attack, and the rest will follow. Most martial arts programs rely on striking the attacker with violent punches, kicks, knees, and elbows, but in our program we take a different approach. We teach children how to defuse confrontations with words and never to initiate physical aggression. If attacked, we offer techniques to neutralize the threat and gain control until help arrives. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. Children’s classes include a well-rounded and balanced mind and body fitness program that includes self defense techniques, special breathing and meditation techniques to build inner strength and relaxation, bare hands forms, the Shaolin staff or long pole, the short stick, plus various strength and flexibility exercises. Kung Fu philosophy and life skills are discussed and reinforced throughout the year. Our aim is to develop self-discipline, courage, tolerance and respect for themselves and for others. In particular, we will develop your child’s mental focusing ability, helping them to learn and concentrate better at school.";;;"Muay Thai Kickboxing, Lee Jun Fan Kung Fu";;"https://camdencombat.com/calendar/";"Mon-Thurs: 3:00pm-8:00pm, Sat: 10:30am-12:30pm";"Kris Kofstad";;"ccmatc@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/camdencombat/";;;;1;;

TPJJ has since grown to two locations in the heart of Honolulu: the Papakolea location at the Papakolea Community Development Center and the Kakaʻako location one block from SALT Kakaʻako.

BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self-defense.[2] Sparring (commonly referred to as ""rolling"") and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition, in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system.

Jiu Jitsu has proven its effectiveness in combat, protecting families, in competition, and every major UFC/MMA arena in the world today. According to FBI statistics, 95% of street altercations end up on the ground. Brazilian jiu-jitsu will help you understand how to control this situation. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a self-defense art that was developed in Brazil during the early 1900s from traditional Japanese Jiu Jitsu and Judo. The movements in BJJ rely on technique and balance rather than strength and agility. These concepts allow a smaller individual to defend themselves against a larger opponent. While BJJ is a form of submission wrestling, it is different in the fact that it is trained with a gi (kimono). The gi simulates a person’s clothing and can be used to control and submit an opponent. Knowledge of gi submissions can be a great advantage in a self-defense situation. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu offers an engaging way to get in shape both physically and mentally. Training BJJ provides the perfect combination of aerobic and anaerobic conditioning to build both strength and increase cardiovascular capacity. Additionally, BJJ has been called “kinetic chess” by many, as it relies heavily on “outsmarting” your opponent. People regardless of age, gender, or athletic ability train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for different reasons; to be more social, to lose weight, to involve themselves with a positive form of stress relief, self-defense or to make themselves a more efficient problem solver. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gives anyone the ability to overcome any attacker regardless of size and strength.";;;;;;;"Fee per month: $35 members, $50 non-members (May attend unlimited # of classes per month)";;;"Kyle Heberle";;;"https://www.facebook.com/jiujitsuokoboji/";;;;1;;

Through our MMA and BJJ instruction, we provide the kids with training in 4 essential areas: (1) character; (2) self-defense; (3) physical fitness; and, (4) fun. The discipline and self-confidence that children acquire in our kids program helps them grow into well-rounded adults and empowers them to more effectively life’s challenges. We acclimatize kids to an active, healthy lifestyle, and build the character, self-esteem and interpersonal skills necessary for peaceful conflict resolution while stressing the importance of safety and cleanliness. We believe strongly that kids with character and self-confidence have powerful coping strategies for dealing with and peacefully resolving confrontation with peers. Our program teaches children basic striking (punches, elbows, kicks and knees) techniques found in boxing and kickboxing (such as stance, positioning, foot work, movement, types of punches and kicks, and putting together combinations of both punches and kicks). Our program also teaches basic grappling techniques found in wrestling and jiu-jitsu (such as take downs, take down defenses, reversals, sweeps, escapes, joint locks, etc., which teach the students how to take down an opponent, to control an opponent on the ground, and to transition from one style to the next; meaning, from standup to ground and/or from ground to standup). Since wrestling and jiu-jitsu techniques rely on leverage and not size or strength (unlike many martial arts disciplines that focus on punching and kicking) a jiu-jitsu practitioner is able to defeat much larger and stronger opponents. The emphasis on technique and the use of leverage, rather than size or strength, coupled with the fact that most confrontations end up on the ground, makes jiu-jitsu a very effective martial art for children. Training in these disciplines will include the use of boxing/kickboxing bags and focus mitts, and will also involve shadow boxing, light sparring and grappling. Our program also uses games to teach the fundamental movements of these individual disciplines because kids often learn best through playing. Additional conditioning techniques will include pushups, abdominal work, resistance exercises and much more. Hand wraps, gloves, shin pads, gi (for BJJ), mouth guard and cup are required, and headgear is optional.";;;"Wrestling / Grappling, Sparring, Judo, Muay Thai, Fight Fit";;;;"Scott Thometz";;"info@combatfitness.com";"https://www.facebook.com/CombatFitnessBoise";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuSAoLsr8vUNCvQckJKq76w";"https://youtu.be/ejuxTO9o75g";;1;;

We believe that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu should be taught in a way that brings the technical, physical (fitness and flexibility), and mental aspect of the sport under one umbrella. The class starts with a dynamic warm-up followed by covering Judo or wrestling takedowns. Next is the drilling of BJJ techniques. Following technique drilling, there are typically 3-6 rolling (BJJ term for sparring) sessions to complete the class. We formulated our Judo children’s program to appropriately reach different age groups, from 4 to 13 years old. We offer classes with emphasis on technical, psychological, and behavioral skills. We also incorporate foundational Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) concepts into our Judo program. The benefits of Judo for children include increased coordination, balance, fitness, socialization, discipline, self- esteem, and more.
