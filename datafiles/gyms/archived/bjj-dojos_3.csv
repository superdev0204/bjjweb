"The Kompound Training Center";"https://www.kompoundtrainingcenter.com/";(303) 222-0039;"4434 Cherokee Street";"Denver";"CO";80216;;"United States";"Brad Nicolarsen’s journey began in 1998 at just 14 years old when he started boxing. An avid participant in team sports such as basketball, he started looking for something more focused and was quickly drawn to boxing. As with everything he does, he threw himself heart and soul into the sport and soon found himself spending several hours a week at Brotherhood Boxing in Denver. After a year of intensive training, he was introduced to the world of kickboxing and Muay Thai. He spent all of 1999 and 2000 focusing on Muay Thai training with renowned coach Oscar Martinez. From there it was a natural progression to look into the world of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which was rapidly gaining in popularity at the time. In 2001 he trained with Dave Ruiz at Colorado BJJ, one of only two existing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gyms at that time. After going to school at CU Boulder, he switched to the other premiere BJJ gym, Easton Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and studied under Amal Easton. After moving to the West Coast in 2003, he earned his blue belt training under Juliano Prado. By 2004, his need to move and to learn got the better of him and Brad decided to go to the source this time, moving to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, where he trained at the Gracie Barra Gym. Here he was able to learn directly from some of the top names in the sport, including Marcio Feitosa, Flavio Almeida, and Carl Inos. He worked endless hours, not only building his own skills but also having the extraordinary advantage of being able to watch many of the top black belts in the sport train. Soon, he was back in the States, completing his education at CU and training once again with Dave Ruiz. He earned his purple belt in 2006 while helping Mike Nickels run his new Colorado BJJ Highlands Ranch school. From there he moved on to train further with Jorge Oliveira, one of a group of BJJ masters out of Rio who trained in Barra and become known as the Barra Brothers, and earned his brown belt in the spring of 2011. In July of 2012 after years of intense nonstop training, Brad was awarded his black belt by Jorge Oliveira. By 2012, Brad decided it was time to open his own gym and in January of that year, he opened Littleton Kompound, still under the guidance of Jorge. As time went on, Brad’s noticed his students becoming more and more interested in pursuing higher level competition within the arena of competitive Brazilian jiu jitsu. Realizing he needed to have a registered black belt affiliated with his gym in order to meet IBJJF standards, he affiliated with Rafael Lovato – considered to be one of America’s greatest grapplers. Since then Brad has been working to make the Kompound a premiere name in competitive Jiu-Jitsu training. He combined everything he had learned from the old school masters and put his own spin on it, bringing it in tune with the times. His hard work paid off when the Kompound was named 2015 Gym of the Year by the Lovato Association. What makes Brad and his gym stand out is that he puts all the focus on the students. As he says, he’d rather train 100 champions than be a champion himself. That’s because he believes so passionately in passing on the knowledge that he’s gained and the love he has for the sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. And he applies that approach to every student who walks through his doors, no matter what their ultimate goal. Whether they’re looking to compete, learn self defense or just want to lose some weight, Brad wants every student to be the best he or she can possibly be and will work with them to achieve their goal. To that end, he’s worked with everyone from collegiate wrestlers to UFC fighters to Olympic athletes, always with that philosophy of focusing on the student and passing on his knowledge in mind. Of course, in order to give his students everything they need he has to remain at the top of his own game, so he does continue his own training as well, but he has never been about self promotion and never will be. And that’s a mindset that he passes along to his students along with their skills. Even with his students who do compete, he makes sure it’s not solely about winning a trophy or a medal but more about setting and achieving your personal goals. And that goal can be developing more self esteem, shedding an extra 50 pounds or gaining your next level belt… it’s all the same to Brad. That’s why he’s set up the Kompound with various classes for different levels of expertise, from beginner to advanced, and even includes women’s classes and classes designed specifically to prepare students for competition. That way everyone who comes through his doors can get something out of the experience. And because he remembers how valuable it was for him to watch others train, he also includes All Levels classes, where athletes of different skill levels can come together and learn from each other. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is about competition but it’s so much more, and that’s what Brad loves about it. The old school traditions of BJJ are important to him and he wants to pass them along to the next generation of athletes. You can’t succeed without respecting where you came from and that means paying tribute to the foundations of the sport. But BJJ is a living and changing discipline and Brad’s focus is on keeping the sport alive. In fact, Mixed Martial Arts is the fastest growing sport in the world today and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu holds a prominent spot within the MMA community. That is why Brad feels so strongly about being a part of spreading the word about BJJ. He wants every student who comes to his Kompound to feel as if they are a part of that incredible tradition too and to take BJJ into the futu";"https://www.kompoundtrainingcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kompound-logo-1.png";"https://www.kompoundtrainingcenter.com/kids-bjj/";"At the Kompound Training Center, we believe in training the right way, right from the start.

Being as a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten every nine seconds and has a 1 in 5 chance of being raped in her lifetime, it would make sense that jiu jitsu would be a recommended form of self defense for a group of people that is (usually) smaller and weaker than the people most likely to assault them. As someone who started jiu jitsu after nearly being sexually assaulted by a taxi driver about four years ago (and has since used it to get myself out of another sketchy situation), I’m a huge, huge proponent of anyone learning BJJ to protect themselves. That said, jiu jitsu has so much more to offer than just self defense. You’ll get in shape, develop lifelong friendships, and have a lot of fun – and that’s only the beginning!

By combining their own unique talents with traditional moves, they were able to make one of the most popular combat sport categories in the world.";"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/583f759d24bedfe2521e81d3/5841739c34f6093632ab90ea_logo_footer.png";"http://wayofjiujitsu.com/programs/jiu-jitsu-for-kids";"“Amazing Denver Kids Martial Arts Class Not Only Teaches Kids Self-Defense … But Gives Them The Tools They Need For Success In Life…” From focusing, to goal setting, to self-discipline, to self-respect - kids emerge from this program changed for the better. And their parents couldn't be happier.";"http://wayofjiujitsu.com/programs/womens-jiu-jitsu";"The number-one reason women are usually given for why they should train jiu jitsu is “because it teaches you how to protect yourself.” There’s a good reason for it: jiu jitsu is designed for weaker, smaller opponents to dominate larger ones using technique rather than strength. Being as a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten every nine seconds and has a 1 in 5 chance of being raped in her lifetime, it would make sense that jiu jitsu would be a recommended form of self defense for a group of people that is (usually) smaller and weaker than the people most likely to assault them. As someone who started jiu jitsu after nearly being sexually assaulted by a taxi driver about four years ago (and has since used it to get myself out of another sketchy situation), I’m a huge, huge proponent of anyone learning BJJ to protect themselves. That said, jiu jitsu has so much more to offer than just self defense. You’ll get in shape, develop lifelong friendships, and have a lot of fun – and that’s only the beginning! If you know a woman or are a woman who’s been thinking about stepping onto the mats, there are plenty of reasons to do it that don’t involve choking out would-be rapists.";;;"http://wayofjiujitsu.com/schedule";"Mon, Wed: 11:00am-7:30pm; Tues, Thurs: 11:00am- 8:30pm; Fri: 10:00am- 6:00pm; Sat: 11:00am- 1:00pm";"Nobuo Yagai";;"wayofjj@outlook.com";"https://www.facebook.com/Way-of-Jiu-Jitsu-Academy-16763629970/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEOpflgUJHabzFfxhuoEsog";"https://youtu.be/w1QWYRzBUUY";;0;331;"Duplicate with id # 340"

His experience is vast and far reaching. Besides Jiujitsu, he is an expert in traditional Karate, weapons systems and modern combatives. With continuous study of his own systems combined with research and study of other common styles of martial arts, his knowledge of martial arts, fighting systems, and training methodologies is unmatched.  Besides his dojo teaching experience, he brings 25 years of risk assessment, health and safety and corporate training experience to the table. During his early years in his teens and twenties he was a top competitive athlete on the state and inter-mountain regional level.   Because of his athletic career and fitness hobbies he developed a keen understanding of athletic training principles and methodology.  With this huge library of information he is able to serve, teach, guide instruct and train his students to achieve what they thought was impossible. Jill Orchard, Charles’ better half has almost 25 years in the martial arts with specific training in traditional karate and jujitsu. She is a very experienced instructor of young children.   Her experience comes from not only her dojo career but from her professional life and church service. With Jill’s vast amount of experience with young children, there is no one more qualified and capable of teaching this awesome age group. Jill is a dedicated wife and mother who also loves to help children, women and young girls find their power, and strength. One of her passions is teaching young girls to be assertive and prepare for the harsh realities of the adult world. Charles and Jill are motivated to help improve the life’s of all those come to them, whether it is in the traditional classes or through their self-defense programs. Empowering individuals to overcome violence and problems in their life’s is truly their passion. Now that you have read the bio, let me elaborate on my martial arts history some. I was very fortunate to be able to learn martial arts as a teen in the very early 1980’s.  The system that my brother helped get me involved with was very unique. Not only did we have traditional karate, not the sport kind, but we also had traditional jiujitsu and traditional weapons systems (kenjitsu, Iajitsu, sai, tonfa, bo etc). These were all under one roof so to speak. This is quite unique and very rare. One of the very interesting things about my training is that we were doing newaza, or ground fighting or brazilian jujitsu before anyone had even heard about it. This type of fighting was common in competitive judo, but not for self defense. We had incorporated it as part of our regular training, with the philosophy of you don’t want to fight on the ground but if you should find yourself there, do what is needed and get up.";"https://www.ftcollinsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LOGO1.png";"https://www.ftcollinsmartialarts.com/kids-martial-arts-2/";"Our goal and desire with all of the kids classes is to teach character, discipline, fitness and life skills while having fun and learning something useful.

Atos Jiu-Jitsu, founded in 2008 by Prof. Andre Galvao and Prof. Ramon Lemos, has become one the most recognized and respected names in the Jiu-jitsu industry. As one of the smallest teams in the sport, Atos has influenced the way the world practices and defines modern jiu-jitsu. Atos Jiu-Jitsu is linked to the evolution of the 50/50 guard, leg drag, and berimbolo. The original Atos team included names such as, Prof. Andre Galvao and Prof. Ramon Lemos, Rafa and Gui Mendes, Bruno Frazatto, Guto Campos, Claudio Calasans, Gilbert Burns, Rodrigo Caporal, Ary Frias, and Davi Ramos. Through their success, the Atos Jiu-Jitsu team has attracted talent from all over the world, and has grown rapidly becoming one of the strongest teams in Jiu-Jitsu. While the team’s origins are based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the team’s headquarters has been based in San Diego, CA since 2010. Since then, the team has added many great names to its competition team roster, including, Keenan Cornelius, Jt Torres, Michael Liera Jr., Michael Carbullido, and many more. There is a great sense of quality over quantity within the Atos team, which relates to our motto, “Together we are Stronger.” The Atos team is currently breeding a new crop of talented Jiu-Jitsu athletes who are successfully showcasing their skills in not only in the world of sport Jiu-Jitsu, but also within the world of mixed martial arts. Many BJJ and MMA competitors seek Atos Jiu-Jitsu as thier brand of BJJ because of the success the team has experienced at the highest levels of BJJ competition. Those such as Anderson Silivia, Carlos Diego, as well as Atos veterans such as Ary Frias, Davi Ramos , Bruno Frazatto and, Gilbert Burns Durinho have demonstrated great success in the most respected international Jiu-Jitsu competitions and are translating this well into the world of MMA. Atos was founded by two friends who shared the same religious beliefs and an intense passion for Jiu-Jitsu. The word “Atos” is the Portuguese word for “acts,”, which specifically references “The Book of Acts” in the bible, based on the belief that “God can do amazing things through ordinary people, when He empowers them through His Spirit.” Today, the Atos jiu-jitsu association members and competitors continue to spread their innovative style of jiu-jitsu across the world.

It will increase their focus, their activity level and their stillness. As Bruce Lee pointed out, behind the punches, kicks, and knees, a true martial artist learns to sit with himself and see where his weaknesses are. In the martial arts, your child will learn what it is to take a hit, whether that hit is a literal blow or a disappointment like failing a test. Part of life is learning that we all take hits. The key is in learning how best to take that hit and get back up. They’ll learn self-confidence and respect. We understand how hard it is to raise children these days. The worries parents can have for their kids are both serious and startling – being bullied by other kids at school, peer pressure to try drugs and alcohol, sexual predators and the adult images in both the popular media and online.

The initial program focused on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, in a time when BJJ schools were few and far between in New England, as well as the Israeli art of Krav Maga which was largely unknown at the time.  In August of 2005 MSDC opened a 7200 square foot facility in Middletown, CT and expanded its programming: now there were multiple daily classes offering Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu both with and without the gi (uniform), Bruce Lee’s Jeet Kune Do, and Mixed Martial Arts.  In addition to all this, MSDC began offering a free self-defense class for members of the community that met every Thursday night (this class ran from 2005 – 2012, every Thursday). MSDC began attracting notable expert guests:  annual visits from world-renowned Jeet Kune Do, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Filipino Martial Arts, and Self-Defense expert Mr. Roy Harris, seminars from notable BJJ standout Mr. Roy Dean, workshops from movement expert Dr. Mark Cheng, rare training opportunities in the art of Kalis Ilustrisimo from Mr. Romy Macapagal, an MMA seminar with UFC veteran Mr. Jason Lambert, and a number of other workshops including Sayoc Kali, Boxe Francaise Savate, Aikido, Wing Chun, and more. During these years, MSDC flourished and provided training to hundreds of people in the greater Middletown Area.  Additional programs grew, including the Adaptive Movement Martial Arts program for kids, and the Boxe Francaise Savate French Kickboxing classes (including two trips to Montreal to train with Kickboxing legend Mr. Richard Sylla). In 2012, Chris Martell was offered a second chance at one of his major personal goals  (a return to the world of Professional Ballroom Dancing), so a team of MSDC’s top talent assumed direction of the facility.  MSDC soon moved to Meriden, CT, into a beautiful facility that was well-designed to accommodate the growing number of group and private classes.  MSDC began training more athletes, including its first Professional Mixed Martial Arts competitor.  A growing number of outside life changes for the management team members forced the team to close the official facility in 2014; however, MSDC’s programs live on. Group classes take place at Adaptive Movement Parkour’s gorgeous and sprawling facility at 60 Peter Court, New Britain, CT.";"https://www.modernselfdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/logo-2.png";;;;;"Jeet Kune Do, Budoshin Ju-Jitsu, Filipino Martial Arts - Modern Arnis, Inosanto Blend of Kali, Kalis Ilustrisimo, Boxe Francaise Savate";;;;"Chris Martell";;"Chris@ModernSelfDefense.com";"https://www.facebook.com/ModernSelfDefenseCenter/";"https://www.youtube.com/user/twinkletoesCT";"https://youtu.be/DpPqq-Fc0Js";;1;389;

We support a team atmosphere and create a comfortable learning experience for all ability levels from beginner to expert. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is an art based in ground fighting. Along with this, it teaches takedowns, takedown defense, ground control, and especially submissions. Submissions refer to holds that either cut off an opponent’s air supply (chokes) or look to take advantage of a joint (such as armbars). Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighters tend to feel very comfortable fighting from a position called the guard, if need be.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a grappling-based martial art that teaches its students to control resisting opponents in ways that force him/her to submit. Generally, gaining this control is easier on the ground than in a standing position. This is why much of the techniques in BJJ are centered around the skill of taking an opponent to the ground and wrestling for dominant positions, rendering the opponent harmless. The main principals behind BJJ are to control and overcome the obstacles of greater size, strength and aggression. This is done by utilizing superior leverage, grip, and position upon your opponent.

The knowledge can be used to subdue and control an opponent with whatever level of severity the student chooses.";"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59716885cf81e00a7f7f8294/t/597168f8be6594f000b60588/1544023170896/?format=1500w";"https://www.graciesportsusa.com/kids-martial-arts-1/";"If you’re thinking about getting your child involved in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, then you’re going to love what I’m about to tell you.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu was formed from Kodokan Judo ground fighting fundamentals. Brazilian jiu-jitsu eventually came to be its own art through the experiments, practices, and adaptation of judo through Carlos and Hélio Gracie (who passed their knowledge on to their extended family) as well as other instructors who were students of Maeda. BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using proper technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self-defense.[2] Sparring (commonly referred to as “rolling”) and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition, in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system.";"https://www.coronabjj.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/corona-1-1-1.png";;;;;;;"https://www.coronabjj.net/classes/";;"Jimmy Tat";;"info@coronabjj.net";"https://www.facebook.com/coronabjj/";;;;1;;

We opened our Academy in 2009 with a mission to give the best possible instruction for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in the most honest way possible. We have succeeded beyond our wildest expectations and for that we are extremely grateful. The truth is I simply wanted to create a place I would be proud to call my second home and to build an Academy where one would be happy to be there whether it was there first time or there thousandth time walking in the door. There are a lot of things that go into making a martial arts gym great. One of the core philosophies that built Heroes is “Cooperation and Competition”. A balance between the two is required in order to train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and have a healthy community of martial artists. Cooperation: I often joke that in real life there is no secret scroll to read, there is no secluding yourself on some mountain for years only to come down to avenge the masters. Actual martial arts training involves working with a partner, there is simply no good way to work the techniques of Jiu Jitsu without an active training partner. The Heroes methodology is to build the best training partners possible: New students are actually shown HOW to train in addition to learning how to work technique. Experienced students are encouraged to work with newer students not only to be able to build them up, but also because the ability to explain a technique is part of the evolution of understanding a technique. Competition: There is a proverb about iron sharpening iron, and so one person must sharpen another. At some point what we learn must be tested in an honest fashion and that comes through increasing the intensity and making the training competitive. That is not to say that students are required to enter tournaments to test their skills, opportunities abound to push themselves in training every day. Heroes Martial Arts has create a unique environment designed to challenge you everyday, but still feel welcoming. Our goal is to use every opportunity to bring out the best in each student. One thing advanced students and visitors have noticed when attending Heroes Martial Arts is the diversity of the students. This is not only referring to the background of each student, but the style and personalization of jiu jitsu that they develop. One quickly notices that no two students play the game alike! Jiu Jitsu is a deep art that actually allows a practitioner play to the preferences and strengths. This was absolutely by design as we feel that having a deep academy with a lot of different styles makes the training ultimately better. One of Heroes biggest strengths is our diversity!";"https://heroesma.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heroeslogohidpi.png";"https://heroesma.com/youth/";"Heroes Martial Arts has Brazilian Jiu Jitsu programs for student 14 years and younger.

Using the tools of both cooperation and competition children will work both in a team environment as well as learn to stand out individually. They will learn to work hard towards a goal, and also to handle set backs with grace. We are building Heroes in training! Our goal is to be one of the contributors in a child’s life to help them learn to be outstanding, well-rounded people.

Women training with other women in an exclusive environment is important. Firstly because Jiu Jitsu tends to be a male dominated sport and it gives the women a safe space to get to come together, bond, and discuss issues pertinent to them. Secondly because the match ups tend to be closer physically and there isn’t the sort of awkwardness that sometime comes with co-ed training (still important), women give each other their most challenging matches.

By the end of 2014, I made a huge decision to change my name from Aftermath BJJ to 99 Jiu-Jitsu, the academy with who we are affiliated. I was greatly inspired by Eduardo Telles, the head instructor of 99 Jiu-Jitsu, and saw that he and I shared the same aspirations of teaching the art of Jiu-Jitsu to people of all  backgrounds. Professor Eduardo Telles is well known in the Jiu-Jitsu world and is especially known to being the creator of the “Turtle Guard” and “Octopus Guard”. I built my Academy to value respect and honor, and we are a school that is very family oriented. Not only are we a great team, we are also a closely-knit family! My first priority was not to be known as the best but to be known as an academy with a great family atmosphere where everyone’s opinion mattered. I strongly feel that teaching my students to have integrity, loyalty, and most of all respect would show them the importance of family values.

The history of Cassio’s Sacramento location dates back to 1996 when Cassio came to the U.S. for the first time. Cassio stayed for a few months and opened a training center with the help of Terry Maxwell. Cassio returned several times to compete, give seminars, and teach at the school and was eventually invited to come and coach full time at an academy in Sacramento (Kovar’s Karate). Cassio and his wife Hilza made Sacramento their home in 2003 and opened his own academy in 2005. Cassio’s instruction has attracted both beginners and professionals alike. As a World Champion and highly regarded BJJ Instructor in Sacramento, many elite athletes such as Randy Couture, Urijah Faber, Dan Henderson, and Frank Mir have trained with Cassio when they need to work on their ground game. Today, many of the BJJ Black Belts teaching in the greater Sacramento area received their belts from Cassio! Cassio brings passion to his instruction and enjoys sharing authentic Brazilian Jiu-jitsu with his students, whether they aspire to be a champion, to challenge themselves or just stay in shape. If you ask a student that trains at Werneck Jiu-jitsu, and they’ll tell you it’s like training with family.

We always begin the class with a Mat Chat that build good character in kid’s by using the powerful words from Black Belts like Professor Mikyo Riggs to encourage good manners, self-discipline, trustworthiness, and much more. From there, we teach striking and grappling fundamentals through fun games that disguise technique practice and give the kids an enjoyable workout. Kid’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (age 8-14 – class is divided by size/skill) - Kid’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu teaches kids the fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and introduces them to sparring. Classes are taught in a safe environment that fosters camaraderie and team unity while inspiring individual confidence and empowerment. Students will learn strategy, drills, techniques, self defense, and play games in this class. This class requires a Jiu Jitsu uniform, also called the “Gi”, and uses a traditional Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu belt ranking system.  Kid’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the pinnacle of our kid’s martial arts classes where we develop a high level of technique in even our beginner students.

All martial arts are systems of combat practiced for many different reasons e.g. self-defense, health & fitness, competition, personal development, etc. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art that focuses on grappling, using leverage to control your opponent. Because of this technical skill, the typical 'presumed' advantages in a physical confrontation such as strength and size are largely negated making it the #1 choice for self-defense. Muay Thai is a martial art that focuses on striking & using leverage to grapple while standing in close quarters. Again the focus is on developing technical skill to use leverage in the clinch and to find angles while striking.

The classes include games related to Jiu Jitsu along with the drilling of techniques and training.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a safe and effective way for children to become involved in martial arts, as well as, learn to defend themselves. BJJ focuses mostly on physically controlling others with leverage rather than punching or kicking. If a situation arises where they are forced to defend themselves, it is unlikely that they will get into trouble doing so since they will not be using punches or strikes to defend themselves. Instead they will be using their learned ability to control their attacker until the attacker gives up or help arrives.

Smoky Hill Road";"Aurora";"CO";80016;;"United States";"Portela BJJ is proud to be one of Colorado's premier BJJ academies serving the communities of Aurora, Centennial and Parker. Our mission is to teach the most effective martial arts and self-defense system in the world, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. We provide services for men, women and children and in a safe, supportive and relaxed environment in which to learn.  Our instructors are very detailed in their instruction in order to ensure that our team members receive the quality instruction they deserve.  Our curriculum is tailored to meet the needs of beginner, intermediate and advanced practitioners so no matter what your skill-level may be, we have the expertise to help you continue your growth in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. For those not aware of the history of BJJ, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art and combat-sports system, developed in the 1920s by the Gracie family in Brazil, that focuses on grappling and ground fighting.  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu promotes the concept that a smaller or weaker individual can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, heavier attacker by using proper technique, leverage and by taking the fight to the ground and applying joint locks and chokeholds to defeat an assailant. To prove the effectiveness of their fighting sytem, the Gracies and others promoted a ""no-holds barred"" challenge to other martial arts and fighting sytems.  All challenges were welcome and accepted and time after time, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu emerged victorious against fighters of all different backgrounds.  With continued development and success, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu expanded to the United States and with the creation of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in 1993, BJJ was poised to become a global phenomenon.  Royce Gracie went on to win the 1st UFC event despite being undersized and overpowered and BJJ accounted for 3 or the first 4 UFC championships with injury being the reason for not acheiving a clean sweep.  Brazilian Jiu-Jitu's proven history of effectiveness continues through today with BJJ being a critical component or primary skill or all current MMA champions.";"http://www.portelabjj.com/images/Portela_BJJ-Revised.png";;;;;;;"http://portelabjj.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=featured&Itemid=503&lang=en";;"Shawn Portela";"Free Week";"contact@portelabjj.com";"https://www.facebook.com/portelabjj";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2_xDaKekt5vlRw768HCO9w";"https://youtu.be/ruGVemmGa_M";;1;;

That's a very good question, and to answer it we need to look at the common challenges that all kids face. For one, bullying is a huge issue among kids these days. Bullying by itself is bad enough, but add on social media and you have a potential nightmare for kids who don't quite fit in. And when you consider that kids are often discouraged from standing up for themselves, it's easy to see that a child who is being bullied will soon begin to feel trapped in their predicament.Gracie Jiu-Jitsu (which I'll refer to as GJJ for short) provides kids with a sort of pressure valve for their frustration and feelings of isolation. For starters, in GJJ kids learn very quickly how to defend themselves. With this knowledge comes confidence that they can stand up for themselves. Child psychologists all agree that confident kids are less likely to be bullied. As well, kids who are socially connected are also less likely targets for bullies. The good news is that while your child gains confidence, they'll also gain new friends and improved social skills in our classes. What this all adds up to is that kids who take Gracie Jiu-Jitsu become ""immune"" to bullying, a process that becomes increasingly more effective and permanent, the longer they attend classes.";;;;;;"Mon, Fri: 5:30pm-7:30pm, Tues, Thurs: 5:30pm-8:30pm, Wed: 5:30pm-6:30pm; Sat: 11:00am-12:00noon";"Anthony Gutierrez";"First 10 days for free";"motivejiujitsu@yahoo.com";"https://www.facebook.com/motivejiujitsu";;;;1;;

Everything at the Kompound Training Center is structured around an individual’s development level. While our class curriculum guides a student from one step to the next, within each class students receive carefully structured training, with skilled instructors, based on individual development. Students progress from one belt to another at their own pace so we are sure they are learning properly. To ensure this, we have several instructors on the mat for each class with one-on-one instruction as they learn the basics for beginners. As children advance through the belts, students will be grouped together with one or two instructors overseeing each group. There will always be hands-on, skilled instruction from masters in the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, to maintain a safe, productive and enjoyable environment. Our dedication to training is not something we take lightly. We believe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is more than a self defense skill; it’s a life skill that helps bolster a child’s self esteem and give them the skills they need by setting and working toward goals. With each goal met, there will be an increased sense of achievement, which can be quite empowering. Children who may be facing challenges in their everyday lives can find a sense of purpose through learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

The Women’s classes focus on all the same principles that are covered in the Fundamentals and All Levels classes. You’ll learn the basic moves, discover how to connect them together into a smooth series of moves and put your Jiu-Jitsu training to work for you. If you’re serious about competing or if you just want to learn an effective form of self-defense, this is the perfect way to do it. Why have a separate class just for women? The difference is preference. It is the same curriculum taught in the Fundamentals and All Levels classes, just taught by female instructor and a dedicated environment.

At Way of Jiu Jitsu Academy we give you the best possible training straight from the source of it all - Rigan Machado is the nephew of Grand Master Carlos Gracie who was one of founders Gracie Jiu Jitsu. Carlos and Helio Gracie learned traditional Japanese Jiu Jitsu from Mithuyo Maeda from Kodokan, Japan. Traditionally, Japanese Jiu Jitsu (also spelled Jujutsu) was used to train for war purposes, not for sport. The Gracies changed all that! By combining their own unique talents with traditional moves, they were able to make one of the most popular combat sport categories in the world. Whether you simply want a super-fun new way to get fit or you want to advance your martial arts career, you will get one of the highest quality experiences available with us.

And their parents couldn't be happier.";"http://wayofjiujitsu.com/programs/womens-jiu-jitsu";"The number-one reason women are usually given for why they should train jiu jitsu is “because it teaches you how to protect yourself. There’s a good reason for it: jiu jitsu is designed for weaker, smaller opponents to dominate larger ones using technique rather than strength. Being as a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten every nine seconds and has a 1 in 5 chance of being raped in her lifetime, it would make sense that jiu jitsu would be a recommended form of self defense for a group of people that is (usually) smaller and weaker than the people most likely to assault them. As someone who started jiu jitsu after nearly being sexually assaulted by a taxi driver about four years ago (and has since used it to get myself out of another sketchy situation), I’m a huge, huge proponent of anyone learning BJJ to protect themselves. That said, jiu jitsu has so much more to offer than just self defense. You’ll get in shape, develop lifelong friendships, and have a lot of fun – and that’s only the beginning! If you know a woman or are a woman who’s been thinking about stepping onto the mats, there are plenty of reasons to do it that don’t involve choking out would-be rapists.";;;"http://wayofjiujitsu.com/schedule-stanley";;"Nobuo Yagai";;"wayofjj@outlook.com";"https://www.facebook.com/Way-of-Jiu-Jitsu-Academy-16763629970/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEOpflgUJHabzFfxhuoEsog";"https://youtu.be/w1QWYRzBUUY";;0;;

Brazilian jiu-jitsu was formed from Kodokan judo ground fighting (newaza) fundamentals that were taught by a number of individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda ,Soshihiro Satake and Isao Okano. Brazilian jiu-jitsu eventually came to be its own combat sport through the experiments, practices, and adaptation of judo and jujutsu. BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves or another against a bigger, stronger, heavier assailant by using proper technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint locks and chokeholds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations.Sparring (commonly referred to as ""rolling"" within the BJJ community) and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition, in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system.";;;"Hawaiian Kempo, MMA Fitness, Cardio Kickboxing, Grappling, Muay Thai Kickboxing, Boot Camp, Individual Sessions, Seminars, Birthday Parties";;"https://www.teixeirammaandfitness.com/schedule.html";;"Glover Teixeira";;"Info@TeixeiraMMAandFitness.com";"https://www.facebook.com/TeixeiraMMAAndFitness/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvs3leMM70GnblI3DEzd-oA";"https://youtu.be/seFKYKHGxjI";;1;;
