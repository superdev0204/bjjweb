Head Instructors are Nova Uniao Black Belts, Todd Meighen and Gregory Hammerton. They were awarded their Black Belts from their longtime Instructor Eduardo ""Dudu"" Barros on May 6, 2013. The school was formerly known as the ""Dudu Barros Jiu-Jitsu Academy"". The name may be new, but the school has been around the Northeast Ohio area since the late 1990's. Eduardo ""Dudu"" Barros grew up in Brazil, and began training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at 11 years old. He started at the Carlson Gracie Academy in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,  training under the legendary Carlson Gracie Sr. He eventually began training with one of Carlson's top students, Andre Pederneiras. Eduardo received his Black Belt from Andre in 2005. Andre Pederneiras is the leader of the Nova Uniao Team in Rio. The Nova Uniao Team is home to former UFC Champions Jose Aldo and Renan Barao, and current Bellator Champ Eduardo Dantas. In 1997 ""Dudu"" relocated to the United States and created the Dudu Barros Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy. The first school was located in his parents' basement. The school continued to grow over the years, and ""Dudu"" relocated the school several times throughout the Akron area. In early 2014, Eduardo decided that he wanted to pursue other interests in his life, and he decided to hand over the reigns of the Academy to Todd and Gregg. The Academy was renamed GT Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with Eduardo's blessing. New name, new location, but the same great quality of instruction! Todd and Gregg are excited to continue Eduardo's hard work!";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/dd8a29_1aaa4c7624a047318966508c8fbeb47e~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_582,h_166,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/dd8a29_1aaa4c7624a047318966508c8fbeb47e~mv2.webp";"https://www.gtbjjohio.com/kids-bjj";"Aimed at kids ages 6-15 yrs old, the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Kids Program integrates physical education and self-defense technique with conditioning and skill-building games aimed at improving coordination, motor skills, agility and flexibility. Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the only Martial Art that will teach your child practical and proven self-defense techniques that can work in real life situations, even against a larger or more physically strong aggressor. Unlike other Martial Arts like Karate or Tae Kwon Do, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu advocates for minimal punches and kicks in self defense settings. This asset makes our martial art an ideal choice for children as it teaches the student to control the situation through grappling without the need for strikes. We will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies, without turning them into one!";"https://www.gtbjjohio.com/female-strong";"Can Women learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu? Absolutely! Women can safely experience the benefits of learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, even if they have little or no experience in sports or Martial Arts. As a Martial Art designed to allow the weaker to defeat the stronger, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a perfect fit for women who are interested in learning how to protect themselves. Female Strong classes are designed to introduce women to the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in a fun, relaxed environment. Most Martial Arts classes are male dominated, and this can be intimidating for Women. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu can be even more intimidating because of the close personal contact involved while learning the techniques. Women may feel uncomfortable training with a male, may be afraid of injury or they may feel so intimidated that they don't even want to try a class. However, seeing a class full of women training can be more inviting and put a beginner more at ease.  This allows females to accelerate their learning by training with other women, similar in size, and by eliminating some of the difficulties that beginner women face training with men. This class will empower Women to learn how to protect themselves, but it is also a great form of exercise. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu students will notice an increase in flexibility, muscle strength, endurance, and general well being. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu will change your life forever!";;;"https://www.gtbjjohio.com/schedule-and-rules";;"Todd Meighen";;"todd@gtbjjohio.com";"https://www.facebook.com/gtbrazilianjiujitsu/";;;;1;1103;

We live in times which force parents to spend less time parenting and way too much worrying about the development and safety of their offspring. Sport classes are great for exercising and focusing the child’s attention but I believe that they fall short when compared to martial arts. The missing link in this case would be also covering the spiritual aspect – believing that both psychological and physical, can be strengthened simultaneously. Signing the youngsters in a form of martial art has been a go-to move for decades among the parental bodies in order to get some aid in the endeavor of raising capable men and women who one day will grow up to be valuable contributing members of our society. Ronin Training Center of Columbus Ohio respects all forms of martial arts. But we have found that Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo have worked extremely well with children to teach them the basic important foundations for living in society: Respect. Discipline. Power. Control. And Humility. The main goal in this art is ALWAYS being aware and controlling the situation. Bjj prides itself on the usage of technique and leverage above everything. That is why it is called – “the gentle art”. The main concept is that you must shorten the distance between you and your opponent and initiate the clinch. Next you use various trips, throws and takedowns to bring the altercation to the ground. Once getting there, certain dominant positions and holds are used by the person versed in grappling to control the attacker. Generally speaking not many systems of self-defense allow the smaller and more times than not – the weaker person to subdue a larger opponent. As a result your child will not be thought to depend on size nor strength. Practitioners learn to defend themselves and control their opponent even without trading punches or using finishing holds that might get you in trouble with the school or the legal system. What you are doing is simply nullifying the potential of the other person inflict harm on you. In my opinion this is the ultimate anti-bullying tool. Having the opportunity to harm someone but choosing not to and making them aware of it. What is even better is that children learn all these attributes including balance, reflexes, flexibility and weight distribution while playing and having fun. Most academies form the teaching and sparring sessions in a form of a game so self-defense and play time are mixed in together in a very friendly environment. But I always say that if the only thing you learned out of your training in a combat sport is how to defend yourself and nothing more…you are clearly doing something wrong.";;;"Muay Thai, Krav Maga, Boxing, Judo, MMA";;"https://bestsitesusa.wixsite.com/ronin/class-schedule";"Mon-Fri: 9:00am-8:00pm; Sat: 9:00am-1:00pm; Sun: 11:00am-1:00pm";"Vitor Oliveira";;"info@ronintrainingcenter.com";"https://www.facebook.com/RoninTrainingCenter/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtJrm6RTtC21PEcQ35aXl5g";"https://youtu.be/2DyTVSYKE3g";;1;1090;

If self control and responsibility is taught to them at a young age they will be able to understand their environment better and not let fear take over them.";"http://www.columbusmartialartsacademy.com/self-defense/";"Today’s society presents many dangers to the people who walk within it. For many of us the conditions of these dangers tend to be almost predetermined to favor adversity. To women specifically, the odds greatly unbalanced. We are led to believe throughout our lives that women are weaker and inferior. We are led by the preconceived notion that because a woman is of smaller size or not as athletic, submission has the greatest chance of survival. One thing we appreciate at Columbus Martial Arts Academy is that the techniques and training of our self-defense class will be able to help the individual defend against any situation despite age, size, or strength. In our Women’s Self-Defense Classes, our students will learn a higher vitality and self-respect. Our students learn to appreciate their independence. Through training, students will learn the finer principles of leverage, momentum, technique and timing that are proven to subdue an attacker with a size or strength advantage. By empowering women, we train these techniques that demand a character that walks with greater confidence so as not to present ourselves as weaker, for the weak-minded prey on the weak willed. Our classes are for women only and will be free of any men with exception to the teacher. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is known to be one the most complete forms of exercise. As you progress though our classes and become proficient in these techniques you find that your body will become stronger, capable, and more effective. We train to ensure that we do not become victims.

Our instructors are committed to ensuring our Kids Jiu Jitsu program provides a fun, safe, and encouraging environment for our young students to learn and grow. Kids classes at Primate Jiu Jitsu teach far more than just the most effective form of self defense. Jiu Jitsu is a social activity as much as it is an independent journey, which gives kids the opportunity to practice social skills and make healthy friends at the same time they build self confidence and self respect through personal achievements. One of the most precious benefits of children’s Jiu Jitsu is experiencing the true fulfillment of rewards that can only be earned with time, sweat, and met challenges. In a world dominated by instant gratification, the value of hard work is an easy lesson to miss as a child and gets harder to learn the older we become. The little ones will work harder than they ever have before, and will be begging to come back tomorrow! Tiny Kids (Ages 6-8) - Our Tiny Kids program is designed for the smallest of our youngsters. Class begins with a traditional line-up, fun warm-ups, and basic movement drills. The instructors will demonstrate a fundamental Brazilian Jiu Jitsu technique and students will pair off to drill it on a coach or on each other under instructor supervision. Towards the end of class, students will participate in supervised “situational rolling.” This is a safe, supervised way for our smallest students to practice their BJJ fundamentals against fully resisting opponents starting from familiar positions. Time permitting, we will end class with a fun group activity such as dodgeball. Big Kids (Ages 9-12) - Once kids reach the ripe old age of 9, we invite them to attend our Big Kids program. These classes follow a similar format to the Tiny Kids classes, but the technical drills will be more complex and include additional details. Furthermore, Big Kids will also participate in “free rolling.” While a situation roll begins from a familiar position (such as the closed guard or side control), free rolling is an open format roll where students begin from a neutral, standing position.";;;"Submission Grappling, Judo, Wrestling";"Adults: Month to Month (No Commitments) $150 per month; Autodraft/30 Day Cancellation $130 per month; 12 Month Contract (1 year Autodraft) $ 110 per month; 10 Class Punch Card $150.

We provide a safe and secure environment where students learn Gracie Jiu-Jitsu in a structured, systematic manner that’s tailored to their level of knowledge, skill, and experience in the sport.";"http://gracietulsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cropped-Certified-Training-Center.jpg";"http://gracietulsa.com/Programs/#Bullyproof";"In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence.  Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 12. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good.  Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence.  Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus!  The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one.";"http://gracietulsa.com/Programs/#WomenEmpowered";"Women Empowered is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 15-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 20 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents.

This highly effective martial art was created by Carlos Gracie in the early 20th century from the teaching of Judo master Mitsuo Maeda and was developed into a fighting style that is renowned for its effectiveness. The art of BJJ is a very positive addition to any lifestyle with huge development in fitness, agility, self-confidence and general physical and mental well being. Our goal is to provide quality training in a friendly and welcoming environment.";"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/54838fdce4b04d71ee5a2632/1417912567205-3PAGOH8IA6L6U5XTQBME/Logo.png?content-type=image%2Fpng";"http://www.ralphgraciebend.com/kids";"Go to any BJJ grappling competition and you will see hundreds of kids as young as 5 years old battling it out on the mats, then sleeping in the stands afterwards! It is clear that these kids enjoy the competition and the sense of achievement from these type of events, but there are a whole raft of unseen benefits that these kids are banking while they enjoy themselves!";"http://www.ralphgraciebend.com/women";"There are many reasons for the increase in BJJ participation amongst women. A quick search of the interwebs will reveal any number of lists describing why BJJ is such a great art for women. Here are the cliff notes from a dozen or so such lists: Fitness /Health – I’m not going to lie; BJJ can be hard work! It combines all of the basic physical health objectives in a single activity – flexibility, muscle tone and cardio.  Read more about the health benefits here. Relaxation / Anti-stress – It may sound counter-intuitive, but BJJ is a fantastic way to dump your worries. When you’re learning something completely new, and trying to merge the mental and physical aspects of a technique… trust me you’re not thinking about the bad day you had at work! Learning a new skill has also been proven to promote brain health. Self-defense – BJJ was originally created as a means for a smaller/weaker person to defend against a larger attacker. It utilizes technique and leverage to defeat size and strength.  You don’t have to imagine that you're going to defeat an attacker – a LOT of BJJ is focused on escaping from someone else; in fact this is the single focus of the new white belt. We run semi-regular self-defense seminars exclusively for women, and these can be a great introduction/taster for BJJ.  Details of our next seminar can be found here. Community – You may be surprised, but rolling around together on the floor is a great way to make lasting friendships. You need your teammates in order to progress and learn - everyone helps each other and together we all get better! The “weird but awesome” factor – So while the growth is women’s BJJ is real, it’s still kind of a niche sport.  Watch the double-takes from your friends as you explain you’ve started training BJJ, and experience the pleasure when you successfully complete their dare for you to choke them!";;;"http://www.ralphgraciebend.com/scheduleevents";;"Paul Moresi";;"pmoresi421@aol.com ";"https://www.facebook.com/RalphGracieJiuJitsuBendOregon/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnrrIbcv9kUoDejSJya1MDQ";"https://youtu.be/61Pxhzu1sjU";;1;1154;

It promotes confidence, discipline,  respect, and many other developmental qualities. Children are like sponges. When they are young and as they grow they  absorb everything they see and listen to. It is important to surround  them in a positive atmosphere so that they grow as an individual in a  positive sense. Jiu-Jitsu allows them to do so. Not only does it teach  them a form of self-defense, it also teaches many life lessons as well  that a child can carry with them. Jiu-Jitsu is one of the most practical  martial arts you can put your child in. When you think about other  martial arts, many involve striking. Do you really want your child  throwing up their fists? Today especially we see a lot of bullying in  schools.  BJJ allows the child to work from the ground and gain control.  We certainly do not want to encourage children to fight if they have  the option to defend and find a way out of the situation. As far as confidence goes, many children are shy or maybe not as  social as others. Putting them in BJJ will allow that confidence to  grow. Whether they are athletic or not, working with our children and  receiving positive reinforcement will guarantee that their confidence  will improve. Also, because of the practicality of the sport the  confidence they gain will not be a false one. Many martial arts such as  karate, incorporate flashy moves or board breaking. While these aspects  may be fun, they are not going to carry over into real life scenarios,  which In return could give your child a false sense of confidence. Another huge benefit for kids in relation to BJJ is the physical  benefits that come along with it. Today’s society is made up of video  games and social media. Kids will spend hours on the couch or on their  computers playing video games and being inactive. BJJ will teach your  child how to live a healthy lifestyle which is so important to learn at a  young age. We all know bad habits are hard to break once they’re  established. Teaching them healthy habits at a young age will result in a  manifestation of a positive life. They will burn calories, increase  flexibility, improve balance and coordination and so much more.   Jiu-Jitsu teaches self-defense but also teaches you how to take care of  your body.";;;;;"https://lobojiujitsu.com/schedule";"Mon-Thurs: 12:00pm-8:00pm, Fri: 5:00pm-8:00pm; Sat: 11:00am-1:00pm; Sun: 12:00pm-1:00pm";"Anibal Lobo";;"info@lobojiujitsu.com";"https://www.facebook.com/loboJiuJitsu/";;;;1;1172;

The martial arts training that we provide here focuses on all these aspects and helps students overcome any limitations they may be struggleing with. At the younger ages we believe in developing core strength, balance, coordination, and situational awarness through extensive training of the muscles and skills that will later provide a beneficial foundation for the martial arts.  In order to keep younger children engaged many of the activities in class are games specially designed to develop specific skill sets and strengths. As the children develop in age and skill more concentrated activities are added and further goals achieved. Students will be taught both grappling and striking combative skills. Students will also be ranked in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in accordance with the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation.";;;"Muay Thai, Krav Maga, Boxing, Kali, Jeet Kune Do";;"https://www.monsterbjjmma.com/SocialSite/BookMe";;"Derek Mangi";"3 Adult MMA Class's with FREE Gloves - $19.99; Kids Introductory Web Special - $69";"info@monsterbjjmma.com";"https://www.facebook.com/monsterbjjmma/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcngNgiwYexOtJoqpM0TMXw";"https://youtu.be/mpFdUfKoLlc";;1;;

Due to the fact that control is generally easier on the ground than in a standing position, much of the technique of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is centered around the skill of taking an opponent down to the ground and wrestling for dominant control positions from where the opponent can be rendered harmless. To control and overcome greater size, strength and aggression with lesser size and strength is the keynote of the sport. This is done by utilizing superior leverage, grip and position upon your opponent. Students of the sport gain a deep understanding of the workings and limits of the human body. This knowledge can be used to subdue and control an opponent with whatever level of severity the student chooses. The path to this knowledge is physically and mentally demanding.

Gregor Gracie Jiu-Jitsu exists to help people make their lives better – kids, adults, athletes, former athletes, new to fitness, moms, dads, grandparents, everybody. We believe that taking care of your body and mind should be the first priority for every human, every day. Without that commitment to yourself, you don’t have much to offer anyone else. Our way of honoring that commitment to take care of yourself is through the practice of martial arts, especially Brazilian Jiu jitsu. For us, martial arts develop both body and mind.

In our Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the best non-violent self defense for children and teens. It promotes confidence, discipline, respect, and many other developmental qualities. Our Kids Programs are integrative, and everyone gets to train and learn together, whatever level of experience they are at. From just starting at 5yrs old or advanced and competing at juvenile, we will create a safe environment. After school and weekends. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one.";;;;;;;"Gregor Gracie";;"info@gregorgracie.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GregorGracieJiuJitsu/";;;;1;;

In 1978, Rorion Gracie brought Gracie Jiu-Jitsu to the United States, and in 1989 he established the first Gracie Academy on North American soil in Torrance, California. In 2012, after 26 years of extensive martial arts training, John Ingallina began training and teaching directly with the Gracie family and established the first certified training center (CTC) in Upstate New York. The center is totally focused on practical, simple, and effective self-defense. We welcome you to - Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Victor. Today, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Victor is not only teaching the same techniques, but duplicating the principles and methodology as taught by Grandmaster Helio Gracie. We invite you to join us on the mat at Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Victor to learn first hand what separates us from the rest! Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is for everyone. At Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Victor, we offer specialized programs for the entire family: Gracie Bullyproof for children (8-14), Gracie Combatives for adults, and soon we’ll be offering the Master Cycle for advanced adults. We also teach a modern Junior Karate program for ages 3 & 4 (Tiny Tigers), ages 5-7 (Little Dragons), & 8-14 (Junior Karate).

Today, our patented teaching methods, unique programs, and welcoming introductory classes, allow anyone to experience the magic of martial arts without feeling intimidated or overwhelmed. While Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Victor is famous for the quality of its group classes, it has been proven that private training gives students maximum comprehension in the least amount of time. Private classes enable the instructor to teach the lessons in the order that will optimize learning and to adapt techniques to suit an individual’s strengths and weaknesses. Each private lesson begins with a review of previously learned techniques, followed by the introduction of 2-3 new techniques. Once you fully understand the new techniques, the instructor will show you how to combine them with previously learned techniques in a series of Reflex Development Drills. This process continues until you have mastered all the techniques in the module. Private classes offer maximum flexibility with daytime, evenings, weekdays, and weekends training opportunities.

Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof program is for you!

Don't forget to check other programs for you and other members of your family.";"http://gracievictor.com/womensSD.html";"Women Empowered is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 10-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 15 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to pink belt! Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the perfect self-defense system for women, but only if it is taught correctly. If you’re unsure about learning BJJ for fear of injury, embarrassment, or any other reason, then the Women Empowered program is perfect for you! If you’ve tried BJJ at another school and had a negative experience, give Women Empowered a chance, and we guarantee it will win you back to the mat!";;;"http://gracievictor.com/styled/page-5/";;"John Ingallina";;;"https://www.facebook.com/graciejiujitsuvictorny/";;;;1;;

Our 8,100 square foot building includes 3 dojo floors, a weight room, parent waiting area, 2 locker rooms and a martial arts supply store! In the late 70's, Sensei Curt Sawyer began training in Isshin-Ryu Karate under Master Joseph Jennings at Jennings Karate Academy in Gates. Sensei Sawyer fell in love with the art of karate and spent as much time as he could at the dojo. After managing the dojo for a year, Sensei Sawyer bought one of the Jennings Karate Academy locations from Master Jennings in 1983, thus starting an amazing career and business building. In 1985, Sensei Sawyer moved the dojo to a different location. The school was growing and needed more space! In the late 80's a second location was created in Spencerport. In 1994, Sensei Sawyer purchased property on the corner of Spencerport Road and Elmgrove Road. He built a new dojo from the ground up and created the largest martial arts facility in Rochester. The Gates and Spencerport locations were combined into one school. 1995 was the first year of The Ultimate Karate Kid Camp. With the new property, we were able to build an amazing Confidence Obstacle Course and have room for sports, games and outdoor classes! Shortly after, Sensei Sawyer changed the name of the business to Samurai Martial Arts and added Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Cardio Kickboxing to our available programs.

This martial art is very active, and requires you to use nearly every part of your body.

"Mat Lab Brazilian Jiu Jitsu";"http://www.matlabbjj.com/";(614) 626-8322;"6903 E Broad St";"Columbus";"OH";43213;;"United States";"One of the first things any serious practitioner of Jiu-Jitsu needs to understand is that ego is the first and the biggest hurdle to overcome. Learn to take each tapout as a learning experience. The people who end up doing the best are those that can lose with a smile. Those people enjoy the art purely for what it is rather then for what that want to make of it. Yes, rolling is an aerobically intense activity. But the best way to build up cardio for this is by rolling. Jiu Jitsu requires balance and mat awareness. The movements are very unpredictable and require muscular power and endurance, flexibility, balance, and cardio. Don’t get discouraged. On your first day, everyone is going to have more experience than you do. Ask questions of your instructor and the higher level belts. Rely on technique, not strength. Know when to tap out, and don’t be afraid or ashamed to do so. Try to escape, of course. But if you can’t, tap. There is much in BJJ that is counter-intuitive. Things like creating space, reaching, framing, posture… they all take time, practice and solid instruction to understand. Pay attention to lessons. Never stop asking questions. Carefully review how you get cornered or setup for subs and passes. Never get frustrated, because the mind shuts down when frustrated and you will miss the finer details that make all the difference. Finally… breathe. Slow, measured. Don’t rush. Don’t burst. Don’t strain. You don’t rush into it at full speed and try to muscle people. Take it easy. BJJ is a flow, not a fight. Train at a reasonable pace and the technique will become muscle memory before you know it. It's impossible to get in Jiu Jitsu shape without practicing Jiu Jitsu. While it certainly doesn't hurt to get in better shape beforehand, it isn't necessary. Dive right in and start BJJ. Your fitness and skill level will improve through attending class regularly. If you're holding off because you think you could do with a bit of preparation first, you may never get around to actually training.";"http://www.matlabbjj.com/images/mat-lab-gold-banner1-800.png?crc=4154443074";;;;;;;"http://www.matlabbjj.com/gahanna-bjj-classes.html";;"Travis Haynes";;;"https://www.facebook.com/BJJMatLab/";;;;1;;

Evolve’s Philosophy is that children must be coached differently than adults.  They must be placed in an environment where learning Martial Arts is rewarding, and applicable in a self defense situation. Many programs out there offer instruction to young children that does little else than give a child a false sense of accomplishment and security. The Evolve Youth MMA program is ran by Head BJJ Coach Shannon White and Head MMA Coach John Cook.  Ms. Shannon and Ms. Allison are the main instructors for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in the GI, Tyler Bause is the head Striking Coach and John Cook runs Wednesday NOGI/Wrestling Class.  It is designed to teach practical Martial Arts including Kickboxing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Boxing, and Mixed Martial Arts; the culmination of many different disciplines of self-defense.  Most schools are just focused on charging you for a belt fee rather than taking the time to teach your child a lifelong art. We believe we owe it to your child to provide him or her with the best instruction possible in a positive and disciplined environment.  It takes time and effort to gain expertise in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai Kickboxing, Boxing, and MMA.  All of our coaches are experts in martial arts and have competed at high levels.  Children will NOT become a black belts in a year at Evolve.  However, they will attain real and valuable knowledge of self defense, it will improve their self confidence, and during the process they will becoming more physically and mentally fit. We offer classes Monday through Friday from 5:30 pm to 6:15 pm  Each class focuses on a different martial art, allowing the children to become well rounded in each aspect, while maintaining their interest for an extended period of time.  Children can also step up to the fundamental training classes at 5:30 p.m, after gaining proficient knowledge and competency of the martial art.

"Next Level Martial Arts";"http://youngstownmartialarts.com/";(330) 550-4324;"5013 Mahoning Ave";"Austintown";"OH";44515;;"United States";"There are a few simple things that make a good martial arts school a great one. We work our hardest every day to fulfill those things, and give our students the best experience we possibly can. Here's what it takes, and what you can expect when you walk through our doors for the first time: Knowledgeable, Passionate Instructors. When hand-picking our instructors, we look for a few key traits: passion for martial arts, passion for teaching, a great personality and expertise. Our instructors truly care about you and your experience. They're here for every question you have and every challenge that arises. They'll push you to try your hardest and motivate you to surpass your limits. Nothing beats having a great teacher - and we have the best. A Clean, Up-to-Date Facility. The best teachers in the world won't make up for a dirty facility with run-down equipment. That's why, every day, we thoroughly clean our studio from top to bottom. And we check our equipment to make sure it's in good working order, and replace it when it needs replacing. We have an incredibly spacious 5,000 square foot facility that provides all the room you need for a safe and productive training environment. Top Notch Education. There is no other academy around that offers the quality and level of instruction that we do here at Next Level Martial Arts. While some schools pride themselves on being a ""fight gym,"" we pride ourselves on giving people the highest level of Martial Arts instruction around. For my staff of instructors, this is a science to us. We have spent, and continue to spend, countless hours training and educating ourselves so that we can provide our students with an amazing educational and training experience. Beginner Friendly Classes. Many schools will say they're ""beginner friendly,"" but they're really not because they simply throw the beginner students in with everybody else and expect them to survive. This is equivalent to taking someone who's never swam before, throwing him in the deep end and telling him to swim back to shore. It doesn't matter how hard that person flaps his arms in the water because he doesn't have the technical and physical ability to swim. He's simply going to drown. The same is true for beginner students who enter into a Martial Arts program; that's why we have separate classes, instructors and curriculums for those students who are just starting out with us. We have a system in place that takes beginner students and helps them through a foundational program to equip them with the fundamentals they need to develop and grow as martial artists. Unbeatable Location. Our academy is located right on the corner of Mahoning Avenue and rt.11. Our academy is easily accessible from Interstates I-80, I-680, I-76 and rt.11. Our Austintown location is within driving distance of all major surrounding cities - including Youngstown, Boardman, Canfield, Poland, Hubbard, Niles, Girard, and Warren. Community. Finally, it takes the right people to make an amazing community. The environment of our school attracts people who are looking to take on new challenges, enjoy socializing with one another, and enjoy having fun. The parents whose kids train with us are caring and supportive. The adults who train with us are kind and fun. It's like a family here, and we'd love for you to become a part of it. Why Choose Next Level Martial Arts? People begin training in Martial Arts at our academy because they're seeking a certain benefit or goal to be met. They want to become more confident. They want to become more fit and healthy. They want to learn to be able to protect themselves. Others want to test themselves so they aspire to compete in sport Jiu-Jitsu or MMA. People begin training for a lot of different reasons, but over time they come to realize that training at Next Level Martial Arts has become so much more for them. They've learned things about themselves that they never knew before. They developed friendships with others that will last a lifetime. They realize that it's not just about fulfilling a desire, but about becoming a part of a group of people who operate like a family. It's so amazing to see the love and support students have for one another training at our academy. And we'd love for you to be a part of that.

Our Academy is about 6,000 sq feet and is set broken into two sides. Side 1 has about a 1,000 square foot section of mats that we use for group training along with a row of 6 Thai Bags for our striking classes. We use side 1 for warm ups and more for the beginners.

Our approach to MMA for our youth program is unique – it combines effective techniques, practical self-defense, functional conditioning and discipline. The first step of our youth program is introductory classes which gives you well rounded basic knowledge and allows for a smooth transition into the regular program. Our regular program consists of two classes per day Mon-Sat and one class on Fri. These classes make up all the different facets of MMA to give our students a well-rounded and solid education on all levels. Unlike traditional systems we do not have belt promotion in our program. The reason being is most belt promotion systems were set up for financial reasons (belt testing fees, black belt programs, etc.). Over the years I have seen an enormous amount of children who had high ranking belts and no practical self-defense skills or combat abilities, which leads to a false sense of security.  Although we don’t believe in belt testing, we do have three levels of advancement:  level 1 – beginner, level 2 – intermediate, level 3 – advanced. The progression through the levels is based on having minimum 80% attendance in weekly classes and once a month sparring class where students will be evaluated on practical application of their skills. Students’ behavior is another important criteria in their advancement through the program. We expect students to be respectful of themselves and others, be disciplined in their training and show ability to follow directions. We also expect students to understand the techniques and how to properly utilize and execute them in the right situation. Each level will require 12-18 months of training to qualify for advancement.

Its origins, however, are in Japanese Jujutsu, Judo, Sumo, as well as the innovations brought about by its Brazilian founders, Hélio and Carlos Gracie. It is most easily described as a sport similar to wrestling. Our Kids Jiu-Jitsu Program is for ages 10-15. It emphasizes grappling, a form of combat that uses locks, chokes, and holds rather than striking. The Kids Jiu-Jitsu Program curriculum focuses on controlling an opponent, transitions, and positional sparring with other students. The techniques the students will learn are explained and repeated in ways that will help younger students remember them more easily. The concepts of perseverance (steadfastness and persistence; not giving up in spite of difficulty), respect (regard and consideration for others), courtesy (acts and behavior that demonstrate respect, manners, and consideration), and self- control (exercising restraint over one’s actions and impulses) are at the core of the program. Jiu-Jitsu is an excellent way for kids to become more physically fit, improve their interaction skills, and develop self-confidence.";;;"Adult Kempo Karate, Cardio Kickboxing";;"http://usmartialartsacademy.com/schedule/";;"David Tester";;;"https://www.facebook.com/USMAAjiujitsu/";"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheUSMAA";"https://youtu.be/95lKROohIn4";;1;;

Perkins Rd, Suite 22";"Stillwater";"OK";74075;;"United States";"Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art, combat sport, and a self defense system that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting strategy. BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique, taking the fight to the ground – most notably by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self-defense. Sparring(also known as ""rolling"") and live drilling play a major role in training. Brazilian jiu-jitsu is not solely a martial art: it is also a sport; a method for promoting physical fitness and building character in young people; and, ultimately, a way of life.";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/41d4a5_b02950a2722ca0062fe5c737c738949f.jpg/v1/fill/w_275,h_275,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/41d4a5_b02950a2722ca0062fe5c737c738949f.webp";"https://www.bjjstillwater.com/classes";"The Kids Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu classes are designed to assist your child’s development into a responsible confident individual.
