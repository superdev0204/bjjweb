"Integrated Martial Arts of Utah";"http://54thstreetgym.com/";(801) 301-6436;"4074 South 300 West Commerce Drive";"Murray";"UT";84107;;"United States";"Our martial arts gym in Murray, UT specializes in the Bihonte (Bee-hon-te) Combativos System, which is a composite group of highly effective developed martial arts systems that combine to form a unique system of martial arts. The Bihonte system has as its core, five unique martial arts systems that each focus on various aspects of hand-to-hand combat. These five systems include Mokuraiken Kempo which is emphasized by lightning fast strikes and low kicks, Jeet Kune Do (Bruce Lee’s method of kickboxing and Wing Chun), ShihKeafma (Filipino Stick and Blade Arts), & Brazilian Jiu-jitsu/BJJ (specifically Pedro Sauer Gracie Jujitsu), and Hai Ki Chi Do (stand up Jiu-Jitsu), each of which was developed and practiced by various martial arts masters and founders who sought to develop one highly effective martial arts system that would incorporate and complement each of the individual systems and yet allow for effective fighting methods which incorporated a blend of striking, kicking, throwing, take downs, submissions, grappling, conditioning, joint locks, individual weapons training, and weapon disarmament. In addition to martial arts training the 54th Street Gym offers Fusion Fit training for men and women which is a unique form of heavy punching bag, focus mitt, thai pad, belly pad, shadow boxing, and plyometrics designed to use the body’s own natural weight for conditioning. It is an excellent way to get in shape, stay in shape, or improve your shape.";"http://54thstreetgym.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Combativos-e1522785286540.gif";"http://54thstreetgym.com/kids-program/";"Looking for a fun, exciting activity for your kids? Check out our kid’s martial arts in Murray, UT! At Integrated Martial Arts, we believe that the foundation of martial arts training should be a broad one. Our children’s martial arts classes draw upon the same great sources for striking, kicking, grappling, and self-defense as our adult classes, but provide that training in a single, integrated format designed specifically for a younger audience. Students will learn grappling from Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, striking from Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Taekwondo, Kempo and Kali, along with self-defense courses, and anti-bullying skills, all in a format that is fun and safe for kids of all ages. We have several programs for kids. Beginners and Advanced as well as a class that is actually done with the parents if they choose to participate. The Beginner Kid’s/Jr. Grappler’s class is for kids that are 7-15 years of age and who have never done any martial arts classes. In the Jr. Grapplers program, we focus on 30 non-violent self-defense techniques that teach children to “neutralize and negotiate” with the bullies. Verbal assertiveness strategies are a major portion of this curriculum. A child needs absolutely no experience to start, and we guarantee a noticeable increase in your child’s confidence within a few weeks! In addition to the Gracie Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, we teach the kids a combination of punching, kicking and simple self-defense skills. The other group is the Kids Advanced for kids 7-15 that have achieved at least a gold belt rank and above. If your child trained in another martial art they may be allowed to participate in this class after an initial assessment period. We want to make sure that every student has a good foundation to allow them to progress with the other kids in the class. Kids in this martial arts class will engage in controlled sparring and grappling. The parent/child class is for kids 4-7. It is done once a week and is often done with the parent so that the parents can work with the child thru the week. We teach the kids basic self-defense techniques while instilling the foundational principles of leverage and control. The secret to the success of this program is that we make the lessons so fun that the kids beg for more!";;;"Jeet Kune Do, Kali, Mokuraiken Kempo, Kickboxing Boot Camp";;"http://54thstreetgym.com/schedule/";;"Dan Berry";;"54thstreetgym@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/gracieacademyutah/";;;;1;1587;

We have a gift that we NEED to take advantage of and use it in a way to help others. As a team it is our responsibility to lead by example and ALWAYS show students, parents and all new comers the power of POSITIVE ENERGY.

Martial arts have always been a valid place for children to develop those traits. Self-Defense. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (sometimes called “The Gentle Art”) is one fo the best martial arts for self-defense. Many, if not all, confrontations in childhood are between two people of unequal size. At the core of BJJ is the ability for a weaker or smaller person to control and neutralize a larger or stronger adversary. BJJ provides the tools to enable the defender to escalate or de-escalate the situation in a non-violent way if chosen. Exercise. Our Kid's programs include a considerable amount of physical activity.

Takeo Yano and Mitsuyo Maeda Taught these skills to the Gracie family. Carlos and Hélio Gracie Created BJJ when mainstream judo took an Olympic turn. Experiments with Judo, grappling and wrestling led them to the new style of BJJ. Furthermore, they passed this knowledge to their family members. In our youth BJJ classes, you will learn the various takedowns, submissions and position techniques that make BJJ one of the most efficient fighting styles in the world. Karate / Kickboxing - Our third and final youth mixed martial arts program is Karate. The Ryukyu islands birthed the development of Karate. Now known as modern-day Okinawa, Japan. Modern Karate was developed from two different martial arts. First, the indigenous Ryukyu Islands martial arts called “Te” (Hand). Second, from the Chinese martial art of Kempo. A karateka is a karate practitioner. Bando Kickboxing is the modern, sports form of kickboxing of Lethwei. Nicknamed in Europe “Burmese boxing of four arms”. UGMMA utilizes the practices of Kyokushin Karate, Shotokan Karate and Burmese Kickboxing (Bando). Therefore, we have the ability to teach a better overall striking game.

He combined his extensive knowledge of Karate, Kenpo, and Filipino Escrima and Kali into a system which is based on the principles and dynamics of motion and physiology which encompass all the martial arts. The Japanese-Okinawan emphasis on strong, well-developed basic techniques, and the fast, fluid weapon and empty hand skills of Filipino Kali-Escrima form the foundation of the A.K.E.A. In addition, concepts from Chinese Kung-Fu, Korean Karate, Kenpo, Jujitsu, and Aikido can be found in A.K.E.A. techniques and skills. All instruction is geared toward use in and preparation for self-defense rather than sport applications. The A.K.E.A retains some of the most important traditions of historical Japanese/Okinawan karate out of respect for the history and contributions of those masters and styles who formed the very heart of the martial arts we practice today. We adhere to the martial arts traditions that foster respect, discipline, personal honor, loyalty, and a sense of lineage. Although the martial arts are often associated with Eastern religious philosophies, the A.K.E.A. finds value in preserving these traditions without religious affiliation. Other traditions that the A.K.E.A. preserves are: belt ranking traditions and practices, the bow of respect, the practice of forms (kata), standards of authority among black belt (Dan) ranks, the practice of breaking (tameashiwara), the practice of weapons along with the empty hand arts, and methods of sparring that differ from sport fighting due to their direct, skill-based application to self-defense encounters.";"http://akeadojo.com/content/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1x3-logo-1.png";"http://akeadojo.com/train-with-us/";"Junior Belt Program - For students under the age of 18, this program is focused on self-confidence, discipline, and establishing good behavior, as well as personal self-defense and fitness.

Teenagers generally attend adult classes, such as our Beginner BJJ class. In addition to staying active and involved in a sport, BJJ promotes respect and discipline and builds up confidence and self-esteem in kids. We have been told many times how our kids' confidence has prevented or stopped bullying or improved behavior in school. While no martial art or activity can guarantee an improvement in school, or bullying, or general behavior, BJJ has helped many of our students.

In BJJ, children learn: Discipline, Respect, Self Control, Coordination. They also experience the rewards that come with hard work and commitment! BJJ  classes will help keep your child mentally and physically fit with a combination of drills, work outs, grappling, and games.  As students grow, they learn to mentor younger students as an important part of their progression. Children are able to compete in tournaments after only a few months, but it is not required. This class is performed in the traditional uniform or “Gi,” which is provided as part of the BVMMA Intro Week.  For children ages 6-13. ";"http://www.bvfit.com/womens-only.html";"The Women's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) class is a great way for women to try out BJJ for the first time. It is a mixture of beginners and those who have been practicing a few years, so you will always have people to help. BJJ is one of the most effective forms of self-defense, as it enables a smaller, weaker person to successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, heavier assailant by learning proper technique and leverage. ​In classes, you will be taught a step-by-step breakdown of specific moves and submissions. A typical Jiu-Jitsu class consists of: A dynamic warm up; An emphasis on instruction and technique; An opportunity to spar or “free roll” at the end (in order to get a chance to apply what you learned). Visitors quickly feel right at home, as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is an empowering and addicting sport where you will grow as a person and find community. Most women will try a Women's BJJ class and end up staying for the mixed BJJ classes.  We have a very friendly and respectful community, so most women feel completely comfortable attending both.

This same journey started in 1928 with Helio Gracie, the father of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ). Helio created the ulitmate form of self-defense. BJJ uses the principle of leverage to allow even a small weaker opponent to be able to dominate. Practioners build endurance, flexibility and learn time-tested techniques. These techniques make BJJ the most effective martial art in the world. Helio taught these skills and techniques to Master Pedro Sauer. Pedro Sauer is a 8th degree red and black belt directly under Helio and Rickson Gracie. He is recognized for the superior technical efficiency of his jiu jitsu. He has instructed and personally trained Mike Diaz for over 10 years. Our PC Jiu Jitsu Alpine classes maintain a high level of instruction, along with top physical conditioning. We offer students the opportunity to learn world-class level instruction in a small classroom setting. Whether you are a beginner or experiened practioner, we have the ability to take you where you want to go.";;"http://pcjiujitsualpine.com/training-programs/";"Our youth program teaches the basic concepts and techniques of Jiu Jitsu and self-defense.

In our program, we will teach you to protect and defend yourself against an attack. You do not need any prior experience and can start the classes at any time.

It’s also a fantastic way for kids to stay fit and learn hands-on about discipline, commitment, and teamwork. The program at Fairfax Jiu Jitsu accepts children from 6 to 13 years old. The Kid’s Jiu Jitsu program at Fairfax Jiu Jitsu is designed to instill confidence and self-discipline while improving balance, coordination, problem solving skills, and mental toughness. Each class includes a warm-up, technical instruction and an instructor-supervised drilling or sparring session. Students train both with the gi (uniform) and without as it is important to understand how to control your opponent in a variety of ways. Assistant instructors are routinely utilized to maintain a great student/teacher ratio on the mat. Martial arts is much more than merely mastery of physical skills. Children enrolled in Jiu Jitsu at Fairfax Jiu Jitsu Academy participate in the Forged Character™ program, a positive life skills and character-building program developed collaboratively with FJJ and a licensed teacher and curriculum specialist. Running concurrent with the Jiu Jitsu training, the program is designed to improve your child’s self-esteem, confidence, humility, discipline, and leadership skills. By working through the program, kids are able to advance on and off the mat, at home, at school, and in their community. The Forged Character™ program helps kids develop into disciplined, respectful, confident teens which make for disciplined, respectful, confident adults. This unique program is ONLY available at FJJ and reflects Fairfax Jiu Jitsu Academy’s belief that martial arts must be about more than fighting or self-defense skills. In the FJJ Kids Jiu Jitsu program, belts are awarded on a merit based system. All promotions are earned and are awarded based on sportsmanship, leadership, knowledge of technique and attendance. FJJ rejects the culture of the “belt factory” that some martial arts have become. We do not believe in “belt tests” in the traditional sense nor is there ever a fee for a belt promotion. Students are encouraged to be competitive when appropriate, but emphasis is placed on improving skills while maintaining good sportsmanship and peer leadership. Students in the program view peers as teammates rather than opponents. All of our kids classes are structured within a friendly and fun atmosphere. Professor Mark Jones is the director of the Fairfax Jiu Jitsu kids program as well as its primary instructor. He is an IBJJF certified 3rd degree black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and has won numerous international competitions including a gold medal at the 2012 International Masters Jiu Jitsu Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Outside of teaching, Coach Mark works with Loudoun County helping children and families as an attendance officer. Coach Sam Kim also teaches the kids BJJ program and is an internationally certified 1st degree black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with over 20 years of experience. Off the mat, Coach Sam is a mental health therapist and certified substance abuse counselor working in private practice with adolescents, adults, and couples.

This class is designed to instill in our young students the values of self-confidence, physical fitness, discipline, respect and mental focus. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art, combat sport, and a self defense system that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting. The art was derived from the Japanese martial art of Kodokan judo (which itself is derived from Japanese Jujutsu) in the early 20th century. It teaches that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique – most notably by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self defense. Sparring (commonly referred to as “rolling”) and live drilling play a major role in training.";;;"Submission Grappling, MMA";;"http://teammannonbjj.com/#schedule";;"Tim Mannon";;"teammannon7@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/TeamMannonBJJ/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0KJZgKwVhXBxQ_hv2CKasw";"https://youtu.be/21GtgHwTem0";;1;;

"Breakaway Jiu Jitsu";"https://breakawayjiujitsu.com/";(757) 223-0373;"11861 Canon Blvd., Suite F";"Newport News";"VA";23606;;"United States";"If you are looking for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Newport News, Virginia, then you need to visit Breakaway Jiu Jitsu. This is the place to learn self-defense, sport Jiu Jitsu or to just focus on overall health and fitness.  Our studio offers different age levels and class times to fit busy lifestyles. Called Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) because it was developed and refined in Brazil, BJJ evolved from Judo techniques and is similar to Japanese Jiu Jitsu, but it focuses on grappling exclusively by teaching “ground fighting.” No weapons are used, and there is no hitting. In ground fighting, a person has more leverage than fighting standing up.  A smaller person can more easily get the advantage over a larger person.  It brings the fight to the ground, where pressure, chokes, and locks allow you to take control and overpower your opponent. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was instrumental in the formation of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), beginning in Brazil as events called “Vale Tudo” during the 1920s.  BJJ is one of four grappling techniques used in MMA matches still today. The ability to participate in this sport is not restricted by sex, age, or size.  It can bring a feeling of confidence and security to your life.  Also referred to as the “gentle art,” it uses not only physical aspects but mental as well.";"https://breakawayjiujitsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/logo.png";"https://breakawayjiujitsu.com/programlist/kids/";"Breakaway Jiu Jitsu in Newport News, VA has Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) classes for kids. Why should your child learn BJJ? Body awareness: BJJ develops motor skills, balance, coordination, and neuromuscular connections. Socialization: Meeting new friends and sharing common experiences is a great way to learn how to communicate with kids of all ages as well as adults and authority figures. Confidence: As kids learn how to use BJJ techniques to overcome their opponent, they will be more confident in their ability to defend themselves and feel more secure. Fitness: What would be better than losing weight and having more energy and stamina? Having fun while doing it. Students don’t need to be athletes to begin classes. Everyone learns and advances at their own pace. Goal Setting and Completion: Improvement, completion, and earning that next belt motivates and encourages everyone to work a little bit harder. Self-Defense: BJJ is a real means of self-defense. In the United States, 25% to 33% of students say they have been bullied. Verbal and social bullying is the most common, yet some can lead to physical altercations. Although bystanders help in such situations, there isn’t always someone close by that can help. Martial arts have been shown to help children who deal with depression or the management of aggression. Initially, this sounds counter-productive, but the motor skills and control needed to perform Jiu Jitsu help children cope with these delicate emotions. BJJ is an effective outlet for children to channel aggression and excess energy. Kids need to learn how to win and lose gracefully daily. Motor skills are not the only benefit of Jiu Jitsu. BJJ will give children a better way to face fears and life challenges by focusing on developing behavioral aspects, such as discipline, respect, self-control, and confidence.

Lacking a standardized curriculum, it is common practice, at BJJ schools around the world, for techniques to be presented in complete randomness. Each day, the instructor shows up to class, having no clue what to teach, and asks the students: “What do you guys want to do?” as if the students know better than he does, as to what should be practiced. Learning in such an unorganized environment can be extremely frustrating and overwhelming. New students almost always feel left behind since the techniques are usually tailored to meet the needs of the more advanced students. In most cases, students experience a sensation known as “Technique Overload” and end up quitting within 3 to 5 months of enrolling, and when they do, the instructor believes that the student’s lack of discipline is to blame. What they fail to realize is that when a student quits, the problem lies not within the work ethic of the student, or the techniques of the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, but within the format in which BJJ is being taught.";"https://i2.wp.com/graciejiujitsufredericksburg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gjjf150.gif?fit=150%2C150&ssl=1";"https://graciejiujitsufredericksburg.com/2019/03/07/gracie-jiu-jitsu-bullyproof-frederickburg/";"Every child experiences bullying, but not every is equipped with the tools to overcome it.

The victims know that they must confront the bully and would like nothing more than to stand up to them. But, they simply can’t follow through for fear of the physical harm that backs the bully’s every action. And, therein lies the challenge - how do you instill in a victim of bullying the confidence to face the tormentor, look them in the eye, and back them down? The answer is simple - teach the victims to defend themselves against physical attack, and the rest will follow. Most martial arts programs rely on striking the attacker with violent punches, kicks, knees, and elbows. In the Gracie Bullyproof program, we take a different approach. All the techniques are purely defensive and utilize no strikes. Furthermore, we teach children how defuse confrontations with words and never to initiate physical aggression.

Women are very capable of learning both Contemporary Jeet Kune Do and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu; however, some may prefer to learn a streamlined art that can be learned in several hours. These self defense classes are taught in groups and provide basic training in self defense. They are founded on the following principle: Escape To Get Away.

Instead of having to remember numerous self defense techniques, the student only has to remember 4 targets: eyes, throat, groin, and ankle. During times of great stress, it can be very hard to remember sophisticated techniques. The simplicity of this system of self defense increases the defenders chance of survival. These classes can be taught in approximately 2 hours and when finished, attendees express increased confidence in their ability to defend themselves.";"Jeet Kune Do, Tracy's Kenpo";;;;"Barry Jenkins";;"pfsblj@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/jkdva/";;;;1;;

Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is a martial art and sport focusing on ground fighting and grappling. It utilizes leverage and technique making it possible to defeat bigger, stronger opponents. BJJ has been proven to be extremely effective since most fights eventually end up on the ground. BJJ has enjoyed explosive popularity with its great success in the UFC and other Mixed Martial Arts events. It can be trained for self defense, sport grappling and MMA training. BJJ is in the training regiment of every successful martial artist worldwide. Translated as “the gentle art”, BJJ focuses on using leverage, technique and positioning to overcome size, strength and aggression. With roots from Japanese Jujutsu from the late 19th century, the art made its way to Brazil in 1910. Here, the Gracie family modified and refined the art and tested it against other styles with great success thus creating the tradition known worldwide. Gustavo Machado BJJ continues this proud tradition as he brought his knowledge and expertise to Virginia in 1998. Studying under Jean Jaques Machado, Carlos Gracie Jr. and Roberto “Gordo” Correa, Gustavo has dedicated his life to teaching BJJ. He operates the main academy in Virginia Beach and is also the President and founder of the Virginia Brazilian Jiu-jitsu Federation. Gustavo has worked extensively with local law enforcement, the Navy and Army and was appointed Hand-to-Hand Combat Advisor for the SWAT team in Norfolk, Virginia.

Brazilian Jiu-jitsu has been proven to be the most effective form of unarmed combat and self-defense, when compared to all other martial arts. The techniques allow for realistic practice, against a fully resisting opponent, without the fear of sustaining injuries. The essence of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is to take the stronger, more athletic and physically aggressive opponent out of his element and into the clinch and ground phase of an altercation, where his advantages can be nullified. Most martial arts never even address this part of an altercation… Brazilian Jiu-jitsu specializes in it! Children naturally like to be rough and tumble… When you put them together for play, they’ll more often than not start wrestling. It’s a natural thing for kids to want to grab, push, pull, tackle and grapple, so most kids easily take to training in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. With Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, there are no fancy jump or spinning kicks, no useless forms to remember, just effective techniques that have been proven to work time and again in real situations.";;;;;"http://topgamebjj.com/schedule/";;"Chris Mahan";;"chris@topgamebjj.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GustavoMachadoBJJ/";;;;1;;

BJJ is a great self defense system that works for women, children and men of all sizes. BJJ relies on technique rather than strength, joint manipulation and chokes rather than strikes, and is extremely affective even when the attacker is on top of you. Real Life Self Defense is the most obvious benefit of practicing BJJ. Other benefits include an almost immediate building of strength, enhanced flexibility, increased balance, and increasing cardiovascular your health. One of the best parts of BJJ training is feeling of self-confidence that comes from knowing you can protect yourself.

This class is structured with a fast-moving pace that allows kids to learn the required skills while practicing in a high-energy format. Because it does not include punching, kicking, or striking techniques, Junior Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu allows students to safely spar with a more realistic level of resistance than they could with impact martial arts such as Karate or Taekwon-Do. This makes for a faster learning curve for self-defense skills, development of physical confidence, and overall proficiency.

Simple, effective physical techniques are combined with vital tactical and strategic training designed to help prevent the need for the use of physical skills. Exertion is minimal to light. Research has shown that attackers will exhibit certain behaviors and look for certain traits in their victims. ThinkSafe teaches both how to project an image of non-vulnerability and how to perceive and deter potential attacks before they become physical. In the event of a physical attack, ThinkSafe techniques are simple and practical, designed to achieve maximum effect with a minimal amount of training. Since the schedule for ThinkSafe classes varies, please contact us about future trainings or about scheduling a custom workshop for you or your organization. Martial Way also recommends women self-defense trainings with The Safety Team, a non-profit organization comprised of seven highly-skilled women martial artists. This team has participated in Martial Way’s ThinkSafe Self-Defense Program, first as students and later as instructors.
