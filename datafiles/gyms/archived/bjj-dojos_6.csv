These five promises have been built since we began building our Martial Arts Schools in 1987. They were birthed out of many years of working with martial arts students of all ages and walks of life. What we learned is that our martial arts schools’ students come to expect a certain level of service. For this reason, we have built our schools and systems around these promises. Instead of asking our students for long term memberships, we found that when we deliver on these following promises our students get the RESULTS they started for, they can’t wait to attend  each class and simply DON NOT QUIT training (many of our students train and earn their black belt which can take 5-8 years) and they love talking about our martial arts schools to everyone they know. Now that you know the history please read on and enjoy the “Victory Martial Arts Schools 5 Promises”. 1. Victory Martial Arts promises to always provide Martial Arts schools with a clean, safe, and uplifting environment that will inspire and motivate you.  2. We promise to provide you with a cutting edge, well organized, and researched martial arts curriculum that results in our students becoming highly proficient in martial arts skills. 3.

We teach children how they can use Jiu-Jitsu against larger and stronger opponents without using kicks, punches, or strength. Kids will learn escapes from a variety of positions as well as the ability to control their opponent without hurting them. Each day in class we let the children test out the techniques against resisting classmates to ensure their confidence in each technique. Sport – Jiu-Jitsu also has a Sport component where the child can use the same techniques in local and national tournaments. Competing with your teammates builds teamwork and a sense of belonging. It is not required for advancement, but if your child has the desire to compete, he/she can compete with the most respected name in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu: Carlson Gracie. Physical fitness – It is estimated that from the early 1970’s until present, the number of obese children has tripled in the United States. Our program has a strong physical fitness component that not only helps the child learn Jiu-Jitsu, but gets them in shape! Our “warm-up” consists of falling practice, pushups, situps and other Jiu-Jitsu related techniques that build a strong body and mind. This method of teaching improves the child’s self-esteem, physical fitness and self-confidence.

These five promises have been built since we began building our Martial Arts Schools in 1987. They were birthed out of many years of working with martial arts students of all ages and walks of life. What we learned is that our martial arts schools’ students come to expect a certain level of service. For this reason, we have built our schools and systems around these promises. Instead of asking our students for long term memberships, we found that when we deliver on these following promises our students get the RESULTS they started for, they can’t wait to attend  each class and simply DON NOT QUIT training (many of our students train and earn their black belt which can take 5-8 years) and they love talking about our martial arts schools to everyone they know. Now that you know the history please read on and enjoy the “Victory Martial Arts Schools 5 Promises”. 1. Victory Martial Arts promises to always provide Martial Arts schools with a clean, safe, and uplifting environment that will inspire and motivate you.  2. We promise to provide you with a cutting edge, well organized, and researched martial arts curriculum that results in our students becoming highly proficient in martial arts skills. 3. We promise to keep our students progressing by monthly monitoring of the results they are achieving and acknowledging their efforts. 4. We promise to treat the family, friends, and neighbors that you introduce to Victory with respect, and because you invited them, we will give them the VIP treatment. 5.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes stand out as a great option if you are looking to challenge your child's mind and body in a way that keeps them excited and engaged.  At Movimento we are passionate about our personal approach to kids’ jiu jitsu classes. While many kids’ martial arts involve repetitive, static poses, we believe that the best training is done through patient instruction and carefully observed, dynamic partner work. Unlike striking arts, such as karate and taekwondo, jiu jitsu uses leverage and body position to throw, sweep, pin, and submit opponents—regardless of their size or strength. This means that while little ones won’t be breaking any boards, the self-defense skills they do learn will be immediately applicable. As they progress, through perseverance and plenty of encouragement, kids will develop a strong sense of self-confidence, discipline, and a healthy respect for others. Classes are designed for kids as young as 7 and require a traditional uniform, called a gi. This encourages the use of highly refined techniques, thoughtful strategies, and careful control. Each class begins with a warm-up, including cardio exercises and fun games. From there we move on to a daily technique, and finish with live sparring. Under a qualified instructor’s constant supervision, kids will be able to apply what they’ve learned in spirited matches with fellow classmates. Passion, respect, and inspiration drive us in our personal martial-arts pursuits, and we strive every day to pass those on to each of our students.";;;"Muay Thai Kickboxing";"Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: 1-2x/Week - Month-to-Month $130/mo, 6-Month Agreement $120/mo, 1-Year Agreement $110/mo; 3x/Week - Month-to-Month $150/mo, 6-Month Agreement $140/mo, 1-Year Agreement $130/mo; Unlimited - Month-to-Month $185/mo, 1-Year Agreement $160/mo.

When an athlete has trained since childhood in activity he or she loves, there is very little that can hold him or her back. We know that firsthand. It required a high degree of physical and mental commitment to compete on the US National Team at an elite level, but collectively, we have many championships under our belts. From winning multiple World Championships, to taking home golds at the Pan American Games, to coming out of retirement to vie for Olympic gold in 2020, we believe there is no challenge too daunting to face. For us, however, it has never been about the medals or the titles, but rather the sense of personal fulfillment at knowing that we had given our best. We have demonstrated through hard work and perseverance you can accomplish your goals and achieve a high level of personal satisfaction that is more valuable than any material reward or public acclaim. The enjoyment of karate training and competition has given us a passion for life and enabled us to travel and form strong friendships with people all over the world. We have also been particularly blessed, having met each other through karate. Together, with our amazing staff, we have built an organization that is inclusive and welcoming of everyone, and has provided people with the opportunity to push past their limits and discover that champion within. By training and sweating with people of all different races, religions, cultures, and economic backgrounds, karate students form strong bonds of friendship and mutual respect. Karate breaks down all barriers and is truly a wonderful, life-changing experience. Karate allows every person to participate at their own level in a comfortable and accepting environment. Although karate is highly anaerobic with very explosive movements, it is an activity that one can pick up at any stage of his or her life and practice for a lifetime. There are a wide range of physical benefits from martial arts training at every age, including improvement in flexibility, muscular strength and endurance, balance, and coordination. In a class environment, a good instructor keeps students motivated and encourages them to establish and achieve their goals, which often come in the way of rank advancement. At FMA, we have had many adults comment on the positive impact that karate has had on them and their families. For example, one father became emotional when he told us that he was able to ski with his family for the first time in many years, as karate training had helped him to lose weight and become healthy enough for it. So what’s stopping you from doing karate? It may seem like something foreign or an activity you might not see yourself doing, but once you start, it becomes infectious. There are so many aspects of karate training that you can focus on. Some people love the history and philosophy of the art, while others enjoy the physical and mental strength that it builds. Some prefer the self-defense aspects and combative side of this martial art, while others simply want to share a fun activity with their friends and family. There is something for everybody in karate training, regardless of age. We have students who are three years old and students who are 73 – and they are equally excited when they accomplish their goal and achieve their next rank.";"http://64.62.135.177/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/logo_vector.png";"http://www.fonsecamartialarts.com/karatetots/";"The Karate Tots program is designed for ages 3 to 4, crucial years in a child’s development.

In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. Little Ninjas Scouts - Contact level: Medium to High Age: 6 to 17 years old Perquisites: bullyproof Required Gear: black Gi (uniform), prepares young people for competition. Training is geared towards knowledge, technique, and defensive skills. Students develop confidence and self-defense abilities, survivals and other life skills.  This is a program for the kids and by the kids. Little Dragons - Contact level: low Age 4-6 years old required wear:  Clean Gi or 11th dimension T shirt.  This he Little Dragons (we offer private lessons for children ages 3-4). Using our time-tested “Gracie Games,” we teach the Little Dragon basic self-defense techniques while instilling the foundational principles of leverage and control. The secret to the success of this program is that we make the lessons so fun that the kids beg for more! Once a child masters all ten Gracie Games, they advance to the little ninja program.";;;;;"https://www.facebook.com/11DAinc/";;"Quinton McCottrell";;;"https://www.facebook.com/11DAinc/";;;;1;598;

We offer Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes for everyone, including men, women, and children – fitness through martial arts and self-defense for the whole family. Whether you want to learn self-defense, dream of competition, need a way to relieve life’s stresses, or just want to get an amazing workout without having to mess around with machines, we have what you are looking for. Our school is sought out by those in the know for specific and hands on training. You always get Black Belt instruction and great student/instructor interaction. This is what makes Carlson Gracie Indianapolis Jiu Jitsu second to none! Brazilian Jiu Jitsu helps the casual student to develop flexibility, increase motor coordination and cardiovascular endurance, and a obtain a greater understanding of one’s fitness. With the fun and engaging training at Carlson Gracie Indianapolis Jiu Jitsu you will get all that and more! School owner and instructor, Alan Stockman, began training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 1997 while living in Fortaleza, Brazil.  He traveled extensively throughout Brazil, training and competing in the cities of Fortaleza, Teresina, Natal, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Porto Alegre. This is where the foundation of his game began. After arriving back in the States he continued training BJJ all over the US, earning his Black Belt after 13 ½ years of hard but rewarding work.  In this time he also successfully competed in BJJ Gi and No Gi tournaments and MMA.  He was one of the founders of the Michiana Fight League (MFL) in South Bend, Indiana, where he co-promoted over 2 dozen mixed martial arts shows.  He was the primary matchmaker for these and assisted matchmaking with many other Midwest promotions as well.  Alan worked closely with fighters from the Bulldog Fight Team, based out of Osceola, Indiana, helping to manage fighters and to promote their careers, seeing 2 of them eventually reach the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Alan says that while he is a fan of MMA, his love is with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and he will always focus his energy on ground fighting and teaching Brazilian Jiu Jitsu as self-defense. Carlson Gracie Indianapolis Jiu Jitsu is new to the area but has exploded onto the scene.  It is one of Greenwood’s best kept secrets for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training. Carlson Gracie Indianapolis Jiu Jitsu offers BJJ classes Monday through Saturday.  The school is located just ¼ mile from I65, so it is easily accessible from anywhere in Indy. The school offers a fundamentals and advanced class for adults.  The fundamentals class  introduces Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to the novice and helps the more advanced player sharpen up on the most important techniques in their games:  the basics.  The fundamentals class is taught from a curriculum that consists of 38 classes.  These classes are the foundation to anyone’s game.  They introduce technique, strategy, and teach players how to think. “One of the things that sets us apart from most other gyms is that the fundamentals here are taught as self-defense in a fight,"" says Stockman.  ""There are two types of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu:  there is 'sport' where you learn how to fight for points in tournaments, and 'self-defense' where you learn how to defend yourself from someone who is attacking you.  Jiu Jitsu was created as a self-defense thousands of years ago.  The sport side of it has really only been around for the last 20-25 years. Sport Jiu Jitsu is fun but should not be the foundation of your game."" Kids classes are offered 3 days a week. The Kids Classes are divided up into ages 4-8 and 9-14 and classes are catered to these age specific groups.  The younger kids learn BJJ through different games, drills, and technique.  The games are designed to teach them fundamental techniques but in a way that keeps their attention and allows them to have fund doing it.  ""At this age it is important for kids to enjoy the class first.  When they enjoy participating in the classes, the sky is the limit on what they are able to learn,"" says Stockman.  The older kids move through the adult Fundamental Curriculum but at a different pace than the adults.  Before training BJJ, Alan was an avid cyclist.  He competed all over the United States.  One of the things that he valued about cycling was the amount of time and dedication it took to properly prepare oneself to compete at a high level and be successful.­­­  “You could not go out there and fake it.  Either you were ready or you were not- there was no lying on the bike,” he said.  “We measured heart rates, calories, wattage output, speed, distances ridden, pedaling cadences, bike weight down to the ounce and we rode around with little computers to keep track of all of this.  We had coaches and mentors that would teach you how to eat, how to ride more efficiently, how to handle your bike, strategy, mechanics that would keep everything working and that would have you fitted on these high tech machines down to the millimeter… cycling was a complete science and was a great way to challenge yourself!  When I found Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, I found a lot of the same things in it that had drawn me into cycling before.  Instead of grinding out 2-3 hour daily rides we were hammering out techniques on the mat, trying to maximize our efficiency and movement, training our muscle memory and our minds as well.  The strategy and tactics in BJJ however, are at a level that I have never seen in any other sport.  It never ceases to amaze me how BJJ can stimulate your mind day in day out.  So BJJ to me is the complete mind and body experience.  Like cycling, I aim to keep myself in peak condition yet I am always able to challenge myself mentally.  Every day, no matter who I train with, whether it be a seasoned Black Belt or a first-day White Belt, I am able to challenge myself and grow."" “Another thing I love about the art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is the way people transform after training and it doesn’t take that long.  Physically, they lose weight, tone up, become more flexible, and as a result they have more energy, are much happier, and become more confident.  And they are learning how to defend themselves!  Martial Arts is very clichéd in that it promotes discipline, confidence, and so on but it does all of this time and time again.  So every day I get to  present and teach this great art of BJJ and I get to see how each person benefits from it.  I see this in adults, I see it in children, in guys and in girls.  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is for everyone, it doesn’t care about age or gender.  It can benefit absolutely everyone!” says Alan. We offer a 7-day pass for anyone wanting to come in and check things out. Try it out for a week if you are not sure BJJ is for you. Make sure that Carlson Gracie Indianapolis Jiu Jitsu is a good fit for you.  We want everyone to be happy and to be learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Give us a call or send us and email to see how you can get started and join the world renowned Carlson Gracie Team!

We teach self-defense so that students will learn to defend themselves in any situation. Your children will learn to become high achievers in their lives. Jiu Jitsu is translated as ""The Gentle Art"" and though Jiu Jitsu they will learn that aggression is not always necessary. They will acquire skills of judgement that will result in being able to deduce right from wrong in a calm, authoritive manner. Through studying Jiu Jitsu they will learn that for every action there is a reaction and will begin to learn how to think ahead. Your child will take this skill into life and will learn how to act and react to everything that goes on around them analyzing situations with a calm, respectful outlook.  It is this attitude of respect for themselves and others that will lead them to become confident, self disciplined, super achievers! All of this with no mention of how much fun the classes are! I bring the same discipline and dedication that it has taken me to get my black belt in Jiu Jitsu into making sure that my classes are exciting, upbeat, and will result that your child will go home buzzing with a real sense of achievement.

Having trained in a number of different disciplines of martial arts since the age of 13, Jack has dedicated his life to teaching others and helping each person maximize his or her own unique skills and attributes so that his art works for them — on an individual basis. On a professional level, Jack is a 3rd degree Black Belt in the art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under legendary instructor Wellington “Megaton” Dias.  Jack is also certified by the International Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation (IBJJF).  Jack has been actively competing in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for 20 years. He is 2013 World Jiu-Jitsu Champion.  At black belt level, he is a 5x Pan Jiu Jitsu Champion, 4x European Open Champion, 6x World No Gi Jiu Jitsu Champion, and 2x European No Gi Champion. In addition to BJJ, Jack is also certified in Bruce Lee’s art of Jeet Kune Do and Filipino Martial Arts (Kali) under legendary instructors Dan Inosanto and Paul Vunak. Jack still considers himself a student of martial arts. That helps to keep his passion alive for his students. Although Jack hones his skills by competing in tournaments, his strength and true passion is teaching others. While many martial arts instructors hold various jobs during the week and teach only in the evening or weekends, Jack makes his living teaching others. It is all he does, and it shows in his students –many of whom have won Jiu Jitsu Championships and Mixed Martial Arts belts";"http://jackmcvicker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/logo1.gif";"http://jackmcvicker.com/programs/kids-programs/";"At McVicker’s Martial Arts Academy, experienced and dedicated instructors teach children effective self-defense skills based upon the martial arts of  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 13. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof program is for you!";"https://gracielouisville.com/women-empowered/";"Women Empowered is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 15-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 20 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to pink belt! Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the perfect self-defense system for women, but only if it is taught correctly. If you’re unsure about learning BJJ for fear of injury, embarrassment, or any other reason, then the Women Empowered program is perfect for you! If you’ve tried BJJ at another school and had a negative experience, give Women Empowered a chance, and we guarantee it will win you back to the mat!";;;"https://gracielouisville.com/schedule/";;"Allan Manganello";"10 Day Free Trail";"gracielouisville@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/graciejiujitsulouisville/";;;;1;662;

Most notably by applying joint-locks and chokes to defeat the opponent. Brazilian jiu jitsu is the most effective self-defense martial art in the world. It's a great martial art for kids, teens, and woman. Gracie United is headed by Professor Rafael Ellwanger in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.

As your child will learn to succeed, you’ll see a new kind of discipline emerging… the kind that will positively affect all areas of his or her life. You’ll notice an increased respect for others, and most importantly, for him / herself. This kind of powerful mind/body connection will make them unstoppable when faced with difficulties in life. Watch your child’s energy, confidence, and spirit rise while he or she becomes strong and confident. We’re not just talking about physical strength, but the kind of strength it takes to resist peer pressure and other negative aspects of life. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a non-striking self-defense martial art system based on leverage and control over the opponent. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is considered to be one of the best self defenses for kids and adults since it’s applied in response to physical aggression, so there’s no need to worry about your child becoming violent.";"http://www.championfactory.com/programs";"Brazilian Jiu Jitsu promotes the concept that a person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique. BJJ teaches you to protect yourself. It offers self defense and helps you get in shape while having fun. In the United States, in every nine seconds, a woman is assaulted or beaten which makes Jiu Jitsu a recommended form of self defense. Nothing can be more comforting than to choke a possible assailant. Wouldn't these be enough reasons for stepping in the mats? But wait, there's more. BJJ is about friendship and respect as much as it is about self defense. You can be the positive role model for the younger girls while they get to learn and respect others. From our personal experience we have seen that the friendship between the jiujiteiras is stronger than most friendship created in gyms. BJJ training is the most effective self defense martial arts in the world, and perfect martial arts for kids, teens and women. We have an extensive woman's program that continues to grow. In this day and age where it's very important to be able to defend yourself, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is the perfect martial art for woman of all ages interested in learning self-defense.";"MMA";;"http://www.championfactory.com/gyms/batonrouge";;;;"batonrouge@gracieunited.com";"https://www.facebook.com/graciebr/";;;;0;675;

Many of the same concepts you are teaching your child at home will be consistently reinforced through classroom discussions in your child's programs. Topics such as: good manners(which include keeping hands and feet to themselves), respect for one's self and others, and following directions the first time and more! Valuable personal development lessons have been built into the Little Ninja's curriculum.

"Imazaki Dojo";"http://www.imazakidojo.com/";(312) 256-5484;"1720 S Michigan Ave";"Chicago";"IL";60616;;"United States";"Sensei Seijo Imazaki started training in Folk style wrestling when he was 10 years old. He wrestled for 7 years in high school and also wrestled Freestyle and Greco Roman in tournaments during the off season. He finished his high school wrestling career with a 124W-14L varsity record. During which he won numerous tournaments all over New York state. In 2001 he started studying Tae Kwon Do. He received his yellow belt and competed in 2 tournaments, one of which was the regionals and he took 1st in his division. Realizing Tae Kwon Do wasn’t for him, Seijo stumbled upon the World Oyama Karate Head Quarters on West 4th st, NYC in 2003. Training there for one month Soshu Shigeru Oyama invited Seijo to be an Uchi Deshi. Although, at that time, Seijo was not ready to take that step, he did in fact fall in love with karate and began his journey. Unfortunately, the Dojo closed down. A few of the Oyama Sensei’s started teaching private classes and over the next three years he took classes, sporadically. Seijo never lost his passion for Karate but hadn’t found the right home yet. Then in 2006, he found World Oyama Karate Dojo in NYC run by Sensei Matsumoto. Soon after joining, he was invited to be an Uchi Deshi. He moved into the Dojo and became a full time student of karate, which means he did Karate at least 6 hours a day and then also cared for the Dojo, with the hopes of opening his own dojo one day. He was an Uchi Deshi for 6 months and received his orange belt within that time. After his time as Uchi Deshi, Seijo was ready for a change. He began training with Sensei Iwata, a former World Oyama teacher. With Sensei Iwata, Seijo trained in the Dojo intensely, rarely missing a class. As a green belt, Seijo would enter full knockdown tournaments and fight his heart out. In June of 2010, Seijo earned his 1st Dan rank from Sensei Iwata. Seijo fought very hard for his black belt, enduring 15, 2 minute rounds consecutively. The test caught on tape has become an inspiration to many. In 2011 Seijo and Sensei Iwata parted ways. Later that year, Seijo went on to win the North American Kyokushin-kai Championship at middle weight. Then Sensei Seijo joined an organization called Kenwakan Karate founded by Shihan Michelle Gay formerly of World Oyama Karate and Kanreikai. At Kenwakan, Seijo was constantly working on everything from technique and kata to fighting strategies and combinations. He trained the fight team and still competes in Full Knockdown Karate. Seijo was given the title of Sensei.He also received his 2nd Dan. Kenwakan gave Sensei Seijo the opportunity to work with children, which is something he always wanted to do. He saw the value in teaching children the art of karate and all it had to offer, physically and mentally. Sensei Seijo helped run the kids and adult programs at Kenwakan. In 2015, Sensei Seijo and Imazaki Dojo were asked to join a world renowned organization called So-Kyokushin. They accepted and consider it an honor to be part of such an extraordinary group of Karata-ka led by Shihan Kazuyuki Hasegawa and Saiko Shihan Diago Ohishi. Currently Sensei Seijo Imazaki teaches Karate full time and is also studying Brazilian Jujitsu. He also has started competing in MMA (Mixed Martial Art). He had his first fight on December 6th 2014. Winner By Knockout Ushiro Mawashi Geri “Back Spin kick” 2nd Round. His 2nd MMA Fight was on Feb. 5th 2015. Winner By Rear Naked Choke 1st Round. Sensei Seijo Imazaki 3rd MMA Fight on June 26th 2015 . Winner Unanimous Decision. April 1st, 2016 Imazaki became the UCL Champion by unanimous decision. He will defend his title this march 18th at the Hammond civic center in Indiana.";;"http://www.imazakidojo.com/classes/";"At Imazaki Dojo, we consider it an incredible honor that we’ve been enlisted to train you and/or your child in Karate. We take a holistic approach to Karate. We believe in the martial way and Karate encompasses so much more than what one learns on the mat. Our goal is to help build leaders on and off the mat. We not only strengthen our body but also our mind. Compassion, confidence, focus and self-awareness are among the few things our program is designed to nurture. Our job does not end when the students step off the mat.  We team up with students and parents of students to make sure that the principles of Karate are being followed outside of the Dojo, as well.  We are here to reinforce the family unit.  To be a black belt in the Dojo, one must be a black belt in all aspects of their life. Our team cares greatly about each and every student we have.  Our goal is to create an environment at the Dojo which inspires children and adults to strive to be the best version of themselves, on and off the mat.  We love to see our students confidence blossom. Our Kids Karate Program is a dynamic way to learn Karate.  Through strict discipline on the mat, the children learn not only Karate but respect and focus.  Dojo etiquette is taken seriously.  We encourage all families to go over the Dojo etiquette on our website so we can teach the children by example.";;;"Karate";"Kids Karate: Our Kids Karate Program is sectioned into 4 seasonal programs per year.

When a woman’s safety is in danger, defending herself through Awareness, Preparation, De-Escalation, Avoidance and Fighting Back is the most ethical decision she can make for herself and her family. But there is much more to it than just physical self-defense. According to the National Institute of Justice, roughly 20 percent of female assault victims are assaulted by a domestic partner. More than 80 percent of rapes are perpetrated by a person that the victim knows. At The Northshore Academy of Martial Arts, Our Women’s self-defense classes are about much more than learning to beat up a stranger in a dark alley.

Nick spent countless hours with Travis helping to hone him and his skills, including traveling to weekend tournaments to test Travis’ proficiency. With his strong foundation of hard work and determination, Travis always brought home trophies and medals for his victories. By age 17, Travis trained almost nonstop, holding high regard and having much respect for the discipline. After receiving his brown belt, Travis earned a position at Nick Tarpein’s School of Karate as a full-time instructor. Three and a half years later, just before his 21st birthday, Travis earned his black belt in the Shorei-Ryu system of Okinawan karate. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to Manager of the Moline Nick Tarpein’s, and the school started to thrive under his management. Just before accepting his new managerial position, Travis had enrolled and started classes at Scott Community College with the intention to advance to Palmer College of Chiropractic. The opportunity then arose for Travis to purchase and become owner of the Moline Nick Tarpein’s, which forced him to make a hard decision between his passion, the martial arts, and his chiropractic education. Fortunate to all who have trained under his expertise, Travis chose to buy the school and dedicate his life to the martial arts. Sensei Travis Tarpein works diligently to give back to his students what was given to him by his father. As well as an outstanding instructor, Travis is still a martial arts student.

It is our belief that diversity of students, physical capabilities, life experiences, and motivations for participating in a martial arts program help foster a unique and positive learning environment.";;"http://munciebjj.com/classes/";"Our kids’ program is open to children ages 6 to 13. We want your child to have fun, set and achieve goals, build their self-esteem and self-confidence, improve their self discipline, and create healthy habits that will serve them throughout their entire lives. Kids’ Class will generally mirror the curriculum of our Fundamentals I class with the addition of more takedowns and more work on the self-defense aspects of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. We believe that self defense should be the central focus of any children's martial arts program. With rising concern about bullying, we want your child to have the confidence to carry themselves in a way that will discourage their peers from making them the target of bullying.";;;;;"http://munciebjj.com/schedule/";;"Max Burt";"Free seven day pass";;"https://www.facebook.com/Muncie-Brazilian-Jiu-Jitsu-120739958014510/";;;;1;;

Increase Awareness: Harassment from bullies can be physical or verbal and delivered at various intensity levels. In each lesson, we focus on teaching your child to recognize and respond to the most common physical and verbal bully behaviors. 3.

Valhalla teaches a structured program of jiu-jitsu that emphasizes its martial, or fighting, aspects. We teach and train students to compete but refuse to water down the traditional art just because some competitive organizations changes its rules. Tournaments and rule sets may come and go but warriorship is eternal. We believe in deep roots and strong foundations. We prefer fundamentals over fads. We despise the weakness in ourselves and push ourselves to overcome it. We seek men and women, young and old, who want to improve themselves and help our team get stronger. We want those who seek a challenge and want to hold themselves accountable to high standards – of physical ability, martial arts skill, honorable character, and team loyalty. Valhalla Academy is exclusive in its membership for a reason. It is true that our Academy is not a good fit for everyone. What we do is not for everyone, and that is what makes us special. We prefer quality over numbers.";"http://valhallaacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/pic_12_130x150.png";"https://www.valhallaacademykids.com/";"The kids program was developed for all children to age 15*.
