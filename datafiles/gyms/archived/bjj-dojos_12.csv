BJJ is a modern adaptation of the 2000 year old martial art of Japanese JuJitsu. Things have changed rapidly over the last 100 years in our culture yet very few martial arts have grown with the times. Machado Jiu-Jitsu, created by the famous Machado Brothers, offers a very modern twist on self-defense. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu’s fundamental fight strategy is to take the attacker to the ground, establish control, and end the conflict on the ground. A startling number of fights will end on the ground. How do I know this? Striking with the hands or feet requires that the distance between opponents is carefully managed so that both can strike on target. The moment one fighter decides to take a step back, or forward, it becomes very difficult for the other person to land quality blows without the proper spacing. Too much distance and strikes can’t reach the target. Too little distance between fighters and you can’t build enough momentum to get in a powerful shot. In fact, it takes professional boxers years to learn how to manage the distance in a fight. If the distance between fighters is managed properly a BJJ Practitioner can take an attacker to the ground without injury. Once the fight hits the ground all the rules change.";"http://timburrill.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/07/logo.png";;;;;;"Day Pass - $20/Day; Unlimited - $159/Month";"http://timburrill.com/schedule/";;"Carlos Machado";"7 day free trial";;"https://www.facebook.com/TB2JJ/";;;;1;1204;

There are many different factors to consider when choosing the right school. We feel that the most important factor in choosing a BJJ, GJJ or MMA school should be getting two dollars of value for every one dollar spent. What you are paying for should be first-class Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and a friendly environment in which to learn the art. When you train at Adamson Bros Jiu-Jitsu school, you will be training under highly trained instructors who go through a grueling 12-week instructor training course every year with Professor Nathan and Zachary Adamson. Customer service is one of our top priorities. Whatever you need, our staff is here to assist you.  One thing that separates the Adamson Bros Jiu Jitsu Academy from all of the others is that we have a specialized curriculum that we teach. This Jiu-Jitsu system is just one of the secrets to our team's success. Most MMA and BJJ schools have no curriculum and basically the instructor teaches whatever pops into their head each night for class. We believe in setting short, intermediate, and long-term goals, and then putting a plan in place to reach each of these goals. Also the Adamson Bros Jiu Jitsu Academy doesn't just concentrate on helping students develop their skills technically and physically, but also MENTALLY!  The Adamson Bros are leading authorities on developing mental skills and sports pyschology skills for combat athletes.  Their students have the results to prove it.

Our friendly and knowledgeable instructors teach women how to defend themselves against a attacker, whether she is on her feet or on the ground.

It focuses on gaining a dominant position over your opponent with the help of techniques such as chokeholds, joint-locks, compression lock, etc. Most Martial Arts require the practitioners to be physically strong to face a larger opponent, however, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu focuses on making use of proper body mechanisms rather than utilizing strength, speed and weight advantages. The techniques we teach can be used effectively by anyone of any age, size, strength or level of physical fitness. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu strengthens women physically and psychologically. Regular practice builds self confidence and allows for peace of mind. Apart from these benefits, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provides women the similar benefits as men.

We train students to protect themselves and their families, instill important Character Traits, and hone skills for Competition. Beaufort MMA began in March of 1997 as McCullough Submission Fighting. The founder, Will McCullough opened the gym due to demand from friends and students of private lessons he had been giving in his garage. The curriculum he put together came to be called Zanshindo and focused on learning the techniques so well that they became second nature or muscle memory. In a self-defense situation, you don’t have much time to think, you can only react. So Will developed his curriculum as a way to build reaction based martial arts that covered self defense from standing, the takedown and on the ground. In its early days, McCullough Submission Fighting became 1 of only a handful of martial arts centers across the US to be officially endorsed by the Ultimate Fighting Championships. In 2003, the gym was passed on to a few of Will’s top students and the name was changed to Beaufort Martial Arts Academy. The curriculum and instruction stayed the same, but more focus was added towards competition. A fight team was developed and students of Beaufort MMA have been in competitions across the nation. In 2014, the business officially became Beaufort MMA and added new classes including USA Boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The same self-defense training is always present even though many new styles and classes have been introduced.";"https://beaufortmma-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/logo.png";"https://www.beaufortmma.com/fitness-class/youth-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-classes-kids-bjj";"Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is a great form of self defense and provides an opportunity for students to compete and get in great shape. At Beaufort MMA, we offer a class specific for children aged 8-14 to train in BJJ (Submission Grappling in a gi). This class is independent from our Mixed Martial Arts class, but offers children a chance to learn and practice gi jiu-jitsu for use in self-defense and competition. If a child is attacked by another child, we want them to be prepared for any situation. Training in the gi allows the children to learn how to use grips and position on the ground to stop another child’s attack while giving the opportunities to learn to escape positions when someone larger tries to hold them down. This is reinforced with competitive matches in the school and at local and regional tournaments from time to time. Competition allows the children to face the struggle of a fight with the controlled environment of a rule based competition with a referee. Children in this class learn self confidence and discipline as well and always have a great workout. The class time allows for children who train in BJJ to continue into the next class, youth MMA, so they can really maximize their time on the mat and your time as a parent.";;;"MMA, Muay Thai";"1 Class / Week $79/month, 2 Classes / Week $99/month, Unlimited Classes $149/month, Ultimate Plus $169/month";"https://www.beaufortmma.com/class-schedule";"Mon-Thurs: 5:00pm-9:00pm, Sat: 10:30am-12:00noon";"Abe Stem";;"info@beaufortmma.com";"https://www.facebook.com/BeaufortMMA";"https://www.youtube.com/user/beaufortMMA";;;1;;

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (Also known as Gracie Jiu-Jitsu) focuses on ground grappling. It is a discipline where a smaller weaker person can reliably overcome a larger and stronger opponent, through the use of skillful technique. Arm locks, chokes, sweeps and pins are just a few of the things you will learn in your training. Our Judo training focuses on standup throwing techniques. Proper application of judo throws allow you to take your opponent to the ground. Judo throws include foot sweeps, hip throws, hand throws, and sacrifice throws. Although BJJ and Judo are competitive sports, it should be recognized that participation in these sports will greatly enhance your ability in self defense situations. Our curriculum was developed to maximize cross-over between gi, no-gi, and self defense. So the vast majority of what you learn can be applied in all of these areas. These sports are also fun and challenging and will improve your physical fitness and mental well being.

During these classes, a child can learn falling, takedowns, controls, and ‘tap outs’ among the older students. Unlike other martial arts, our daily classes do not incorporate any punching or kicking elements but focus primarily on grappling. Through demonstration, the students will learn a series of techniques in each lesson, and after preparation, they will have the opportunity to implement the technique in a supervised and control sparring session. Due to the fact that we have removed all dangerous kicking and punching from training, students can spar during training sessions as well to increase their level of proficiency in the sport. Children of all ages enjoy grappling and can learn how to use these movements with peers.";"https://chattanoogajiujitsu.com/classes/womens-jiu-jitsu/";"The main reason that women give for training in jiu-jitsu “this is how women can protect themselves”. There are many reasons for learning jiu-jitsu, it’s ideal for smaller and weaker opponents who need to dominate a large opponent using a technique in lieu of strength. As a woman in the U.S., there is an assault or a beating every nine seconds. Every woman in the U.S. has a 1 in 5 chance of being a victim of rape in her lifetime. doesn’t it make sense that learning jiu-jitsu is an ideal means of self-defense for the smaller weaker opponent? Jiu-jitsu is more than simply learning self-defense. It’s a way to get into shape, learn lifelong habits, make lifelong friendships, and have a lot of fun while doing it. If you know someone, male or female, who is considering taking a martial arts class, jiu-jitsu is an ideal choice. There’s no need to be worried.
