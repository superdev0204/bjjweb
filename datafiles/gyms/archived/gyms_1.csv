Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is one of the worlds fastest growing forms of martial arts. This is due to the fact that BJJ is one of the most commonly used forms in many elite level MMA (mixed martial arts) organizations. The reason for this is that the form and technique for BJJ allow you to control your opponent by using their own body and momentum against them. With proper positioning, Jiu Jitsu can allow a smaller person to overcome a larger and stronger opponent.
​
BJJ for Self-Defense
One of the main reasons people choose to learn a martial art is to learn how to defend themselves if the need arises. For the purposes of self defense, BJJ is one of the most practical and efficient forms of martial arts to learn. The reality is, if you need to defend yourself, you won't be able to stand face to face with your attacker, and strike them multiple times with your hands and feet, which are focuses of martial art forms like Karate and Tae Kwon Do. More likely, your attacker will approach you from behind or the side.

​With this in mind, Jiu Jitsu focuses on using your opponent's own body and momentum to neutralize them. This will allow you and your family to have the tools necessary to neutralize a threat as efficiently as possible.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling but especially ground fighting. It was derived from the Japanese martial art of Kodokan Judo in the early 20th century, which was itself then a recently-developed system (founded in 1882), based on multiple schools (or Ryu) of Japanese jujutsu.
BJJ can be trained for self defense, sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition. Sparring (commonly referred to as ‘rolling’) and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition.

How Martial Arts Helps Students Succeed in School

Martial arts instruction has long been recognized for its ability to turn average or sub par academic students into honor students achieving A’s and B’s. Parents know that better grades in school can strongly influence a child’s overall success in life. Feedback from parents across the country indicates that there are an extraordinary number of cases where children involved with martial arts training are improving academically, sometimes dramatically.
Build Your Child’s Confidence and Self Discipline

Enrolling your child in a Far East Martial Arts & Fitness class will benefit him or her in many different ways. Our aim is to help them to understand street safety, when to walk away from a fight, and how to be a more helpful and understanding person growing up. Children need structure from a young age. Self discipline is something that is taught not given. We strive to show our kids respect for one self and others.

Facts About Bullies

BULLYING STATISTICS:
Thirty percent (30%) of U.S. students in grades six through ten are involved in moderate or frequent bullying — as bullies, as victims, or as both — according to the results of the first national survey on this subject. Bullying is increasingly viewed as an important contributor to youth violence, including homicide and suicide. Case studies of the shooting at Colombine High School and other U.S. schools have suggested that bullying was a factor in many of the incidents.

RECENT STATISTICS SHOW THAT:
1 out of 4 kids is Bullied. The American Justice Department says that this month 1 out of every 4 kids will be abused by another youth. Surveys Show That 77% of students are bullied mentally, verbally, & physically. In a recent study, 77% of the students said they had been bullied. And 14% of those who were bullied said they experienced severe (bad) reactions to the abuse. 1 out of 5 kids admits to being a bully, or doing some “Bullying.” 8% of students miss 1 day of class per month for fear of Bullies. 43% fear harassment in the bathroom at school. 100,000 students carry a gun to school. 28% of youths who carry weapons have witnessed violence at home. A poll of teens ages 12-17 proved that they think violence increased at their schools. 282,000 students are physically attacked in secondary schools each month. More youth violence occurs on school grounds as opposed to on the way to school. Playground statistics – Every 7 minutes a child is bullied.

***Martial Arts not only teaches children valuable self-defense skills, but also the importance of self-discipline, courtesy and respect. Additionally the health benefits are tremendous, and your child will soon be in the best condition of his or her life. The newfound strength, concentration, and motivation of your son or daughter will soon be evident in his or her school performance, home-life, and while participating in other sports & activites. Basically, studying the martial arts is a win-win situation. So, don’t hesitate; call today or stop by for more details, and to make a positive change in your child’s life.";"http://martialartswestvalley.com/womens-classes/";"

We pride ourselves on a friendly training atmosphere focused on the technical aspects of Relson Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Whether you’re looking for self-defense, sport BJJ or just a great way to get fit while learning to defend yourself this will be a good school for you.

We are a club, not a commercial business. Having operated as both, we much prefer the club atmosphere. Our priority is to train productively and safely in a fun, friendly environment. As such, we keep a close eye on the make-up of our school and have in the past asked people to leave who have created a disharmonious atmosphere.

Classes are friendly and non-competitive. Our goal is to train and learn technique, not to pummel each other. However, do not mistake compassion for weakness; we have regular sparring matches as part of every class to test skills and provide aggressive training. We are not primarily a MMA school, although we have students who successfully compete in Mixed Martial Arts or No Holds Barred competitions. Our club has local and federal law enforcement officers, business and medical professionals, athletes, and individuals from just about all other professional fields.

Our reputation as a highly-technical and knowledgeable club is one we are proud of. Our school has solid relationships with all of the other BJJ schools and view many of the other instructors in town as our colleagues and friends. Our club provides a low stress environment that puts a premium on technical mastery and improvement.

Kid’s Brazilian jiu-jitsu is a martial art, combat sport, and a Self-Defense system that focuses on grappling and ground fighting. BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique, taking the fight to the ground – most notably by applying joint locks and choke holds to control and defeat the other person.

The Strongheart BJJ program places a strong emphasis in physical, mental, and spiritual development for the purposes of self-defense and personal growth. In addition, we have a Competition Team that hones the sport side of Jiu-Jitsu and we have several State and National Champions training within our program.

"Kajukenbo Arizona";"http://www.kajuaz.com/";" +1 480-755-3008";"3978 E Chandler Heights Rd";"Gilbert";"AZ";85298;"5/5 Stars";"United States";"Kajukenbo was founded in 1947 at Palama Settlement on Oahu, Hawaii. It developed out of a group calling themselves the “Black Belt Society”, which consisted of black belts from various martial arts backgrounds who met to train and learn with each other. This was the beginning of an evolutionary, adaptive style designed to combine the most useful aspects of the arts.

In the late 1940’s, Palama Settlement was a violent area and fistfights or stabbings were commonplace. From this environment, the founders of Kajukenbo wanted to develop an art that would be readily useful on the street. As they trained and fought in and around Palamas Settlement, the founders of Kajukenbo quickly gained reputations as formidable street fighters. In 1950, Adriano Emperado, along with brother Joe Emperado, began teaching the new art in an open class. They called the school the Kajukenbo Self Defense Institute (K.S.D.I.).

The emphasis during training was on realism – so much so that students routinely broke bones, fainted from exhaustion, or were knocked unconscious. Nevertheless, the reputation of this tough new art drew more students and Emperado opened a second school at the nearby Kaimuki YMCA. Soon Emperado had 12 Kajukenbo schools in Hawaii, making it the second largest string of schools at the time. John Leoning, who earned a black belt from Emperado, brought Kajukenbo to the mainland in 1958. Since that time, Kajukenbo has continued to flourish and grow.

Kenpo emerged as the core around which this new art was built. Kenpo-Karate is a combination of two very devastating self-defense forms. Kenpo means “Law of the fist” and Karate means “Empty hands.” Both forms develop the use of hands, elbows, legs, eyes, ears and alertness in Spirit, Mind and Body.

The true origin of Kenpo is obscure but credit has been given to Daruma the 28th Buddha from India, who immigrated to China about 525 AD. Because of the geographic locations of India, China Korea, Okinawa and Japan the interchanging of ideas and principles was tremendous.

Sijo Emperado realized that Americans fight differently than the Asians and as a result many of the old techniques were revised. He successfully combined modern Kenpo (Hard Style) with elements of other martial arts to form Kajukenbo style between the years 1947 and 1949.

The primary focus of our Kids Martial Arts program is practical self defense. We don’t create bullies, but our kids will NOT be bullied by teaching practical skills for real-life situations. We work on standing techniques as well as ground fighting techniques. Our students develop their inner warrior spirit.
At Kaju AZ we (take out also) understand that Karate and Martial Arts is more than kicking and punching. Our Kids/Teens (take out stuff) become goal-oriented, strive for academic excellence, increase self-confidence and help our students develop a fitness-for-life mindset.

Kids/Teens that progress and have a desire to do more are offered an opportunity to gain leadership qualities by joining our Junior leadership program: SWAT. The Special Winning Attitude Team develops the leadership skills to be used in all areas of their lives, and they often assist in our classes and at seminars. Our SWAT Juniors are an amazing example of great future leaders in the community. 

Kids/Teans also utilize our special CrossPIT cardio conditioning program to get into shape, become physically stronger, with increased cardio and stamina. Our kids CrossPIT has been utilized as a special training program and summer training camp for other sports programs including football, wrestling, volleyball and swim teams. Our intent is to teach a love and respect for fitness as a way of life. ";"https://www.kajuaz.com/personal-safety-ladies/";"

Seven Keys to Personal Safety

    Believe in Yourself: When you believe in yourself, you’ll trust your wisdom and your strength.
    Understand Reality and FACE IT: Don’t think it can’t happen to you because it can.
    Stay Aware: Stay aware, wherever you are, whatever you are doing.
    Trust Your Intuition: If your intuition is warning you, there IS something wrong. Trust it, and act to increase your personal safety.
    Develop Your Body’s Strength: Being strong and confident makes you MUCH less likely to be targeted.
    Fight Back: Fight with 100% conviction in your right and ability to protect yourself.
    Learn Practical Self-Defense: Practice makes perfect. Keep working toward getting stronger, more confident and able to defend yourself and your family at any time or any place.

Self defense is NOT violence!

A Safety Tip from Michael Linehan
We have, at times, spoken to women who were initially reluctant to learn truly effective self-defense because they thought of it as violent – as lowering themselves to the attacker’s level. A surgeon can wield a knife (scalpel) to save someone’s life. A predator can wield a knife to harm someone. “Wielding” your self-defense skills to preserve your life, and to return to those who love you and need you, is a powerfully positive and life- affirming action. It has NOTHING in common with the actions of those who prey on others for their own pleasure. So, if you haven’t made a decision about this before, please consider it now – because, when you are in the middle of a situation it might be too late to think about these matters and to decide what you are willing to do. Give yourself permission – right now – to do what you need, to defend yourself. Then, if you ever need to, you’ll be prepared to act immediately, decisively and powerfully to protect yourself.

Inspiring!

Bushin Ryu classes at the Budo Shingikan inspire you to reach higher than you think possible. Our dynamic instructors guide you through the intricacy and beauty of Japanese martial tradition, and in the process you will find yourself drawn into the learning experience along with your fellow students. Dare to be great!

Challenging!

The Bushin Ryu curriculum requires you to demonstrate a wide range of martial technique in a variety of situations. You will find yourself challenged as you come to understand that true martial arts have little to do with punching and kicking. The subtle nature of internal structure combined with both gross and fine motor skill development requires you to devote your powers of concentration fully to what you are learning.

Holistic!

Bushin Ryu training is very different from a kickboxing workout. Training in the traditional Japanese martial arts involves both physical and mental dimensions. You will also find that working collaboratively with a partner changes the entire dynamic of the learning experience. Developing the skill of connecting to another person in the process of learning immerses students in a truly holistic training experience.

Safe!

We view safety as the number one priority in martial arts training. In Bushin Ryu, we spend a great deal of time learning how to safely move and connect, whether one is in the role of ""attacker"" or ""defender"". The occasional bump or bruise is inevitable in martial training, but it is essential that students and instructors maintain a high degree of ""situational awareness"".

Fun!

If training isn't fun, you won't last very long. That's why we make every class a fun experience! The Budo Shingikan wins ""Best Dojo of the Year"" in Mesa each year because it truly is the most enjoyable place to train.

Sensei Dedeuc D'Antonoli

Our Dojo is led by Sensei Dedeuc D'Antonoli. Sensei started his path in the study of martial arts in 1992 in Kenpo Karate in Carmichael California. Since that time Sensei has never encountered a form of Japanese Martial Arts he hasn't enjoyed training in and learning about. He has studied many styles of martial arts, and in general has a deep passion for Japanese culture and tradition.

He is a full time martial artist and has dedicated his life to the pursuit of learning and teaching others. Many martial arts school instructors teach martial arts as a part time job, or hobby, and many no longer pursue their own studies. Sensei continues to study and teach full-time. Sensei took up full-time teaching duties in 2006. He was awarded a Senior Teaching License, the highest level teaching license awarded by his instructor.

Sensei has been teaching martial arts to children for many years, both in the United States and in Mexico. His goal is to ensure that classes get kids moving and teach them valuable skills both in terms of self-defense and life outside the dojo. But above all, he believes classes should be fun!

Sensei is recognized by the International Martial Arts Council and has been inducted into The United States Martial Arts Hall of Fame twice in recognition for his contributions to the international martial arts community.";"http://www.martialartsgilbert.com/assets/school/633/logo.png";"http://www.martialartsgilbert.com/klma";"Dear Friend,

My name is Dedeuc D`Antonoli, Owner and Chief Instructor of our martial arts school.

We started our kids program 10+ years ago, and haven't
looked back since.

Why? Because, as you’ll very quickly discover... martial arts is about
so much more than ""punching and kicking"" for kids.

It’s about helping them become better on the ""inside"" too.

Every class is packed with lessons on character development.

Kids learn how to focus better...

... how to listen the first time they’re asked...

... how to work hard and be disciplined...

And more.

Plus - in our classes - children achieve a LOT.

The more they achieve, the more they believe in themselves...

And their confidence soars.

That's what it’s really all about.

But don’t just take my word for it. See what your Gilbert

While our Little Dragons learn basic and safe moves to give them a head start, Children’s Beginners are able to partake in more advanced classes because they have an improved level of physical ability.

Depending on your child’s level of experience and belt, he or she will learn all of the techniques and can compete against kids from other schools if you are comfortable with it. The benefits of taking a Children’s Beginners class from a relatively early age are multiple and we discuss them below.

Our programs are designed to increase confidence, self-discipline and self-esteem (shy kids attract bullies; confident kids repel bullies). Our emphasis is on Character Development as we foster Black Belts of Excellence for life by incorporating traditional taekwondo (kicking and punching) along with contemporary, dynamic teachings including boxing, grappling and kick boxing techniques.

Utilizing our “Six Tasks” Character Development Program, our students are taken on a journey that changes their behavior not only inside our academy, but more importantly, at home and at school. Students are sent on a mission to record 50 acts of kindness, courtesy and respect, which enable our students to learn by applying as they complete their first journal. Students are then rewarded their Respect Badge.

Emphasis is placed on rewarding our students for good behavior. Our Academic Achievement certificates and patches encourage students to seek honor roll grades and then reward them for their accomplishments. Rank testing is not only used for belt progression, but also for teaching goal setting. Students learn that they must put in the action steps required to test for a new belt and then reset the goal once they have achieved it.

Our Lil’ Dragon Program was designed specifically to prepare your child for kindergarten. It includes instruction in safety skills, life skills and martial arts. These skills help your child become well rounded by developing their social, emotional, physical and intellectual growth. A few things Lil’ Dragons will learn: to follow instructions, take turns, act respectfully, problem solve, show self-control, socialization, build fundamental motor skills, increase their focus ability and promote stamina and coordination.

We encourage our parents to be patient and not compare their child to others. As our students stay faithful to attending class twice a week and practicing at home, they will improve and suddenly become “the focused one” everyone on the bench is pointing out.

"Attitude First Martial Arts Academy";"http://www.attitudefirst.com/";" +1 623-547-5337";"3530 W Yorkshire Dr";"Glendale";"AZ";85308;;"United States";"Attitude First Martial Arts Academy is the Valley’s leader in developing strong, confident and healthy youth!  We have the belief that it takes a village to raise a child. Mom, Dad, and anyone that is doing their best with today’s youth needs all the help they can get in making sure their child/teen grows up into the fine adult that they want. Yet, there are moments where many parents struggle with questions of:

Why is my child so disrespectful?

When children are rude, they are expressing themselves in a manner that may be caused by an inner battle that can be overcome with discipline and structure through effective positive reinforcement.

Why does he/she lack confidence in school?  

When children don’t believe in themselves, it is more often because they believe more in what others express to them. So-called friends and other adults are telling a child that he/she is “stupid,” “not going to get it,” “dumb,” “slow,” or “ugly” to name a few. It is very important that children have personal successful experiences to draw from so they can build their own positive images of themselves and not rely on what others think.

Why am I so scared that my child is following the crowd – the wrong crowd?

When a child follows in the footsteps of others, he/she is normally looking for acceptance/belonging, or does not have the courage to say no. There is no doubt that the pressures of youth have increased tenfold over the last few decades – drugs, sex, peer pressure, and bullying continue to rise.  The need to develop the child’s ability to separate true and false support comes with experience and/or honorable mentoring.  The need to avoid the pressures comes from a community of like-minded individuals that supports and models the child’s own goals and values.

Why are other kids picking on my child? Why are they so mean?

Mean kids and/or predators seek out victims when they recognize them as weak and helpless.  Unfortunately, that aspect of our society will be difficult to change.  However, arming a child with awareness, confidence, and a belief in him/herself is incredibly important to minimize these situations.
We have found, and studies have proven, that the environment OUTSIDE of the home that surrounds their child will become one of the biggest factors of a child’s long-term success. The environment needs to be where the child can be:

    An individual, yet feel a part of a team
    Held to a high standard of performance that is achievable, yet raises the level of their mental, emotional, and physical maturity
    Surrounded by great examples to model by peers, adults, and leaders 
    Accepted for who they are and the family is welcomed
    And most importantly… Surrounded by the belief that they are capable of success, NO EXCEPTIONS!

With our more than 31 years of experience serving the community and a staff with more than 100 years of teaching/mentoring experience, we have found that Attitude First Martial Arts Academy is the ANSWER.  With our documented system approach, dedicated staff, and family atmosphere, we provide the expectation and commitment to bring out the best in the Valley’s youth…and YOUR child.

Please call (623) 547-5337, email: info@attitudefirst.com, or fill in the information on the right side of this page for information about obtaining your free classes. (We will be glad to call you.) ";"http://attitudefirst.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/logo-new2.png?quality=100.3015020819330";"http://attitudefirst.com/lil-attitudes5-and-under/";"The Lil’ Attitudes classes are designed for the 3- to 6-year-olds whose parents want their child to learn self-confidence and self-discipline. What differentiates the Attitude First Martial Arts Academy (AFMAA) is that even though this class is filled with laughter, fun, and movement, the child will learn the basics of self-defense in the process.  More importantly, the child will learn how to follow instructions, interact with others, the importance of exercise, when it is appropriate to use certain skills, being aware, and mostly, how to defend him/herself.  

    As we have found over the course of 35 years of instructing, for a child of this age group to learn, it is important for the lesson to be on the student's level using his language and frame of mind.  This half-hour class is specifically designed with this age group in mind.

    Self-Defense

    Our young martial artists have the opportunity to learn the American Kenpo Martial Art system.  Kenpo is a self-defense system that incorporates hand strikes, kicking, submission grappling, and weapons with a realistic approach to defending oneself in a modern world.  They will exercise their skills by learning Forms, Sets, and Freestyle.  There will be ample opportunity to also explore competitions. 

    Family Self-Defense

    Attitude First Martial Arts Academy believes so strongly that a family that plays together, stays together, that we provide FREE to all of our members the opportunity to bring their family on the mat to share in their experience.  Parents, aunts, uncles, siblings, grandparents, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren have all participated.  Wear comfortable clothes and enjoy the experience! ";"http://attitudefirst.com/womens-self-defense/";"Today's environment for young ladies has dramatically changed!  They have several battles to contend with: image, friends, school, social media, bullying, and predators. 

    Can they be expected to have the confidence to defend themselves as they navigate the daily issues of communication, appearance, dating, and socializing?   Our answer... Absolutely! However, they need to be aware of their choices and learn to be responsible for these choices.

    Unfortunately, statistics show that once an individual is victimized (regardless of the level), they are more susceptible to being victimized again.  Additionally, the level intensifies with every experience.  Early awareness and development of confidence can help to prevent this cycle.

    Our Women's Self-Defense program is designed to introduce the awareness of effective choices in the event of an undesirable situation.

    The Women's Self-Defense program will concentrate on the following items: 
        Awareness - To be able to recognize, scrutinize, and revise your actions based upon what you are seeing, hearing, and feeling.
        Environment - To understand and use what is in you, on you, or around you to keep you safe.
        Fitness – To find balance, opportunity, and strength to survive your ordeal using the 5 fitnesses: physical, perceptual, mental, emotional, and spiritual.
        State of Engagement – To discover your state of readiness when you are prepared mentally and physically to take action.
        Abilities – To recognize the opportunities to control the situation by using the best available actions to protect yourself.
        Methods of Execution – To learn and apply the simple and direct movements to all defensive and offensive actions.
        Skills – To learn to physically maneuver, block, strike, manipulate, and fall in times of crisis.
        Action – To understand that when your safety is concerned  - hesitation can harm you.   You will learn how to mentally and physically move in the NOW!

    This is an interactive, physical class and participants should plan for this. If underage, guardians will be asked to be present during part of the workshop.   We request that participants wear durable clothing.  For example: T-shirts, sweats, and shorts are appropriate and soft-soled shoes such as tennis shoes.   Please bring a water bottle, towel, pen, and notepad. ";"N/A";"N/A";"http://attitudefirst.com/class-schedule/";"Monday:  5:30 - 8:00pm;

Hi, we are Master Jessiah Rueckert and Mrs. Sharon Rueckert and we are the owners of Inspiration Martial Arts. When we began our martial arts journey, the positive impact it had on our lives was remarkable. It was always our dream to someday own our own school, and when we opened Inspiration Martial Arts in 2005, we made a commitment to our community in Moon Valley to create an enjoyable environment for students to improve their fitness while building confidence they can carry into their everyday lives. It is our privilege and honor to take the the knowledge we have received in our own martial arts training and pass it on to the students at our school.

MARTIAL ARTS IS NOT JUST KICKS AND PUNCHES!

We teach all of our members to focus on and be present in the moment. In this age of distractions and sensory overload, this is a skill which returns immediate results in all aspects of one's life. Here are some interesting facts about Inspiration Martial Arts:

    Our members are from all walks of life - we have students, attorneys, doctors, engineers, military and law enforcement all training in a fun, team-oriented family environment.
     
    We have kids that have been training for years that leave to top colleges and universities in the country, thanks in part to the discipline and focus on hard work they learned through martial arts. This is something we take a great amount of pride in.
     
    There are always new generations of individuals and families coming in to pursue the ongoing legacy. It is a tradition in martial arts to pass down the knowledge one receives in their training and many students become instructors, often ending up owning their own schools.  

It is our goal to inspire strength, discipline, confidence and focus in our students, to help them discover their inner leader. I believe every child has the potential to be a leader, they just need someone to believe in them. As a parent myself, I understand the challenges of raising a confident and focused child in an age where there are more distractions than ever.

And while the kids have their fun, our adult program is second to none. From traditional martial arts to more modern self-defense styles, there is something for everyone at Inspiration Martial Arts. If you are looking to burn major calories, learn self-defense moves and get in the best shape of your life, you must come and check out our adult program.

Imagine yourself as a stronger, more confident individual in the best shape of your life. I want to personally invite you to take advantage of our introductory trial offer, and turn that vision into a reality.

It would be a privilege to meet you and your child to have them step into the wonderful world of martial arts.";"https://inspirationmartialarts.com/upload/override_logos/1474319134InspirationMA-Logo-DKbg.png";"https://inspirationmartialarts.com/programs/children-martial-arts";"PARENTS IN Moon Valley and Glendale ARE ASTONISHED BY THE POSITIVE IMPACT MARTIAL ARTS CLASSES ARE HAVING ON THEIR CHILD!

You might naturally associate martial arts with hollywood stunts and kicks and punches, but the self-defense aspect of martial arts is just part of it. Children that learn martial arts develop the confidence to know that if they are ever bullied, they have the skills they need to defend themselves. However, the real skill we teach is diffusing situations with words before they ever escalate to a physical level.
We teach children to focus. In this age of distractions and sensory overload, this is a skill that will provide immediate results in their academic work. 

Martial arts help teach self-discipline and socialization skills. In fact, many parents whose children have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report great success with these programs because self-control and concentration are commonly underdeveloped skills in ADHD kids.


And did we mention ... martial arts is FUN!
Consider these benefits of martial arts when enrolling your child:
 
• Fosters self-discipline
• Boosts socialization skills
• Encourages physical activity
• Teaches kids to set and achieve goals
• Increases self-esteem
• Instills a sense of respect
• Encourages non-violent conflict resolution
• Improves listening skills
• Develops teamwork skills
• Improvement in other areas of life


What does ""improvement in other areas of life"" mean? It can mean getting better grades in school, knowing how to use anti-bullying programs to prevent violence amongst peers, or simply the appreciation that comes from learning and mastering a difficult skill through practice.

Perhaps most importantly, students learn that physical activity is a healthy way to have fun. With health problems such as diabetes and obesity affecting more and more young people, parents should take steps to help their children avoid these issues. Children's martial arts gives kids a fun way to exercise, learn essential life lessons and develop a sense of self-reliance.";"N/A";"N/A";"Adult Martial Arts";"N/A";"N/A";"Monday 02:00 PM - 09:00 PM

A Few Words
From Abel Ucelo

I’m Abel Ucelo, Head Instructor here at Ucelo Martial Arts.

As a martial arts instructor with extensive experience training kids, there is nothing better than seeing them grow firsthand.

But more important than the martial arts skills they learn… is the personal skills they develop and carry for life.

Because martial arts is so much more than just kicking and punching, and getting the next colorful belt.

It’s about developing confidence, discipline, character, focus and respect.

With every class we teach, your kids are growing in mind, body and character.

That’s because martial arts provides instant positive feedback. Through learning to focus on the core moves, they develop discipline and respect. They can instantly see and feel a difference, making them destined to build confidence, self-awareness and self-respect.

And of course it’s a ton of FUN!

That’s why I love teaching martial arts to kids in this community, and why I know your kids are going to LOVE training.

So please have a look below to find out exactly how your kids can benefit from our fun martial arts classes.

Thanks!

"10th Planet Jiu Jitsu - Phoenix";"http://www.10thplanetphx.com/";" +1 480-553-0009";"1239 E McKellips Rd #116";"Mesa";"AZ";85203;"5/5 Stars";"United States";"10th Planet Jiu Jitsu was created by Eddie Bravo under the tutelage of Jean Jacques Machado. It is a unique style of no gi Brazilian Jiu Jitsu which was made to work both inside the cage and on the sporting mats. The intentionality behind the creation was to have an unorthodox style which could keep an opponent under constant control and in the threat of danger. The 10th Planet system was put to the test in Abu Dhabi 2003, and it succeeded masterfully by facilitating Eddie Bravo's victory over long time reigning champion Royler Gracie. Immediately following that victory, Eddie opened his own school to further the system.

 

What separates 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu from other styles is its innovation and evolution. Some of the moves, like the Rubber Guard, the Twister, and the Lock-Down have taken the Jiu Jitsu community by storm because of their originality and effectiveness. The moves mentioned here are so different that opponents do not know how to react to them and they leave the practitioner in a unique position to execute with little to no defense from their opponent. Moreover, the beauty of the system does not stop there: Eddie and his students are constantly inventing new moves and counters to old moves in order to keep the style relevant and functioning. So, where other systems cease to grow, 10th Planet finds itself in a situation where its entire focus is to continue its own growth.

Late in 1994 MJ Shaw moved to Mesa, Arizona and opened the first Arizona Shaolin Kenpo Academy. Master Tony Sandoval and The Sandoval Karate Kobudo Federation.

In early 1997 Master Shaw was approached by Larry Naranaho and asked to continue his studies under his direction. Larry was the senor student under Master Tony Sandoval and the Sandoval Karate Kobudo Federation. Master Shaw continued his studies with Larry for the next couple of years. He was awarded his 2nd degree Black Belt from the Sandoval Karate Kobudo Federation.

Soke Robert R. Bugh and The Shebu Ryu Aiki-Turi-te Jujutsu Kobujutsu Asssociation

From 2000 to 2004 Master Shaw continued to study with Larry, but also studied at numerous seminars with a wide variety of styles. During this time, he met Master Albert Fabian the senor student of Soke Robert R. Bugh. Master Fabian spent the next year teaching Shebu Ryu Aiki-turi-te Jujutsu Kobujutsu at The Arizona Shaolin Kenpo Academy. In 2006 Master Shaw was asked to test with the Shebu Ryu Aiki-turi-te Jujutsu Kobujutsu association. Master Shaw was promoted to his 4th degree Black Belt.
Grandmaster George Lim and The Lim Hawaii Kenpo Federation

During this time Master Shaw met Grandmaster George Lim from Lim Hawaii Kenpo Federation. Master Shaw and his students took seminars and attended Belt Promotions given by the Lim Kenpo Federation. Master Shaw was asked by Grandmaster Lim to teach at the gathering of the Master’s Seminar that Grandmaster Lim hosted each year. Master Shaw was honored to get the chance to teach Martial Artists from all over the world. He was also very honored to be promoted by Grandmaster Lim to the rank of 5th degree Black Belt in 2007. This had very special meaning to Master Shaw. Not only was Grandmaster Lim promoting him, but also it was done at the gathering of the Master’s, which was attended and blessed by the late Grandmaster Sijo Adriano Emperado. Master Shaw continues to maintain a great relationship with Grandmaster Lim and the Lim Hawaii Kenpo Federation.

Master Sam F.S Chin from The Chin Family Iliqbhuan association.

Also during this time Master Shaw met Master Sam F.S Chin from the Chin Family Iliqbhuan Association. APSK hosted Master Chin’s workshops and seminars for the next six years. Although Master Shaw spent very little time with Master Chin, his Tai Chi and Zen principles changed Master Shaw. He learned how to be more aware. He understood how to combine the internal and the external into a more effective self-defense combination.

Master Shaw realized, because of his varied wealth of experience and his dedication in seeking the ultimate fighting system, that each fighting system they had studied offered something unique. Each also had its glaring weaknesses that could make a fighter vulnerable. Master Shaw concluded that, there were only four ways of fighting.

    Kicking (with foot, leg, knee, shin). This will keep distance from the opponent.
    Striking with your hands or use of any part of the arms, elbows, forearms, etc.
    Felling – this is to trap, break, throw, or knock an opponent off his feet. This includes tripping, pulling, pushing, shoving, or scooping him.
    Grappling – by either wrestling, holding, breaking, and locking bones or joints against nerve centers.

APSK Martial Arts philosophy dictates that the ultimate in self-defense lay not in one way or style of fighting. By combining the “Four Ways of Fighting” we devised and developed ways to integrate diverse methods of fighting into one, eliminating weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

“APSK Martial Arts uses the fast and direct, straight line approach of the American, Japanese, and Polynesian Kenpo styles and mixes it with the circular movements of the Shaolin Kung Fu. In addition to teaching self defense, APSK Martial Arts has proven itself to have the modern day advantage that helps our students to achieve success and become a leader in all areas of their life.”

This is the central theory and method behind APSK Martial Arts. This fighting system is the backbone of the APSK Martial Arts system. APSK feels that this is the best for promoting overall good health, wisdom and longevity. This system is well balanced, incorporating mind, body and spirit into one real fighting system. APSK is renowned for its devastating kicking and punching techniques. It incorporates the movements of five animals: Tiger, Crane, Dragon, Snake, and Leopard. The APSK Martial Arts theory of fighting is based on circular movements, speed, conditioning, and developing strong internal energy, tendons, and ligaments. These are essential for producing a superior fighter.

APSK system also incorporates the venerable art of Chin Na. It is the form of neutralizing an opponent, utilizing holding, seizing, locking, throwing, felling and delivering controlled pain. No other martial art gives such control over an attacker.

The masters of APSK are pioneers of martial arts in the Western World. They have enhanced the martial arts, directing it to better understand how to combine the internal and the external into a more effective self-defense combination.

Also because of Master Shaw’s friendship with Grand Master Lim, he has had the opportunity to work with other great Grand Master’s and Master Instructors. One of the great Grand Masters is Grand Master Olohe Solomon Kaihewalu. From 2009 to 2012, Master Shaw has been allowed to to provide the dojo for GM Solomon Kaithewalu’s seminars in Arizona.

Master Shaw sincerely gives thanks to all of the Great Masters and Grand Masters that have allowed him to participate in there family martial arts.

Paul trained under his mentor Gustavo Dantas/Nova Uniao from 2001-2015. During this time he found much growth, and opportunities in the BJJ community.

One of Paul’s dreams was to teach others and share this sport that had changed his life in so many ways. He took his first teaching job in 2007. After being a BJJ instructor through several valuable experiences he knew it was time to open his very own school. While Nava BJJ the program had already found its way into his past opportunities, Nava BJJ the school opened its doors in August of 2010. For 2 years the small location grew, and it was obvious that a larger space was needed.

So after 2 years of growth the next location opened its doors, and has been thriving ever since. As of October Nava BJJ is now affiliated with Samir Chantre BJJ. One of Paul’s most valuable endeavors is founding the D.A.N. tournament. In its 3rd year the DAN was Named after his son who alongside his wife, and daughter suffer from a disease called Neurofibromatosis type 2. This event has become a great success in helping bring awareness to a cause so important to the Nava BJJ family.

KID’S BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU

Invest in your child’s future today by enrolling them in our jiu jitsu program! Students between the ages of 4-13 can participate in this action-packed, fun and educational class.

Steve Rosenberg, a second-degree black belt from Nova Uniao, has been training and teaching for 15 years. Steve has designed the kid’s jiu jitsu program to enhance student well-being by teaching them goal-setting, self-defense, discipline, integrity, respect and more.

Students will gain a host of positive mental and physical skills that will help them in school, at home and in life! As your child will learn to succeed, you’ll see a new kind of discipline emerging: the kind that will positively affect all areas of their life. You’ll notice an increased respect for others, and most importantly, for themselves. This kind of powerful mind/body connection will make them unstoppable when faced with difficulties in life.

Are your kids facing any issues? Our program can help with the following:

 

    Focus and Attention
    Our classes can help develop and improve student focus. If your child has focus and attention issues, our program helps students cultivate their focus little by little until they are able to participate in the entire class without being distracted.

    Bully Prevention
    In the event your child is experiencing bullying at school or online, our program will arm students with the tools needed to defend themselves and call for an authority figure. Most confrontations can be talked through, however sometimes words aren’t enough. Your child will be prepared for any situation.

    Weight Management
    It’s easy for kids to not exercise and stay home playing video games. Our balanced curriculum of technical jiu jitsu instruction and related game-playing keeps students active and improve their self-confidence!

"Axe Capoeira Arizona";"http://www.axecapoeira-az.com/";" +1 602-345-1561";"1650 N Scottsdale Rd";"Tempe";"AZ";85281;;"United States";"

Grupo Axé Capoeira of Arizona is well known throughout the state for laboring tirelessly to share the cultural richness of capoeira, sharing a positive message of respect, diversity and community. Capoeira is a dynamic sport that combines elements of dance, acrobatics and self-defense. it’s Brazilian culture through movement!

Having opened the first capoeira academy in the valley, we now offer several other programs and disciplines. We also have several capoeira classes in other locations such as the Arizona State University Tempe Campus.
";"http://www.axecapoeira-az.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/watermark-light.png";"http://www.axecapoeira-az.com/classes/kids-capoeira/";"
Why is Capoeira great for kids?

Capoeira provides a multi-faceted outlet for children in the prime of their self-discovery, creativity and imagination! Through the beautiful combination of martial arts, music, dance and language, they learn about themselves and make amazing discoveries. Our instructors encourage discipline through a means of self-responsibility and choice-making, not punishment. Our students learn about the Afro-Brazilian culture and have opportunities to learn Brazilian Portuguese through the practice of capoeira and its song. As a part of our program, children are exposed to musical instruments and song that cannot be found anywhere else. They also receive workshops in folkloric dances of Afro-Brazilian culture. Capoeira encourages growth on many levels and helps to teach and instill the value of loyalty, responsibility and self-confidence. In addition to the benefits above, Capoeira helps to build a strong and positive character and personality through self expression in a fun and playful environment.
What is my teaching method/practice?

In my 20+ years as an educator in various venues and art forms, never have I come across a more incredible, fulfilling and enriching experience as I have teaching capoeira to children! I enjoy teaching adults too, but there is something so magical about the discovery, the creativity and the ownership that I see children gain by training in capoeira. With every new experience and growth spurt, each class is exciting and challenging for the students and myself. I believe in teaching the whole person, no matter what age -through experience, discovery, practice (lots of practice) and integration. In class we make connections to what they are learning in their classrooms at school, what they see in their daily lives, other cultures and practices they may or may not be aware of and of course, themselves. Being “well-rounded” is no longer enough in our quickly changing world. Owning a sense of malleability, adaptability and creativity in all types of situations is extremely valuable. It is also important for our children to learn about how their bodies work at an early age, for longevity and understanding of the physical self. Injuries and long-term damage occur too often in instruction of children. Everyone has their own kinesiological fingerprint too! I teach my students basic anatomical and kinesiological awareness through imagery and metaphor. Movement is the single common language we as humans all share. Through movement practices, like capoeira, there is much to be learned!
What to Expect:

You can expect an exciting and invigorating class for your child! Class will last for one hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays and just under two hours on Saturdays.  You may also hear them humming or singing our songs in the car after class.

Items to bring:

    Water
    Non-restrictive clothing (please wear long pants and as much white as possible)
    A snack for your child to eat after class
    A happy face and positive attitude

Sure sending the kids outside for a while is a great option, but going for up to two months without participating in any type of structured program can make the return to school in August quite difficult. Summer programs are a great way for children to participate in actives, stay fit, and socialize with other children in a structured and monitored environment.

We have developed a program based on traditional Taekwondo for kids called Karate for Kids.

SAFETY & SELF-DEFENSE
Karate can be a lifelong endeavor that makes a huge contribution to your overall well-being. The actual physical moves (blocks, strikes, kick) apply directly to self-defense, and your karate kid will also experience safety lessons designed to prevent abduction and molestation and help children manage the schoolyard bully.

Children develop confidence when they work in a structured classroom. This structure allows them to anticipate what will happen; they say to themselves, “I know what to do!  I know what to say,” therefore, their level of participation rises. As they participate more, they develop more confidence, and participate even more, creating an upward spiral toward success!

DISCIPLINE & FOCUS
Your child’s academic performance will improve because of better focus and concentration. Focus begins with getting still, and one of the first lessons in Karate for Kids is standing still or “standing like a black belt.” Your child will learn to “listen with the eyes AND the ears.” From this simple beginning, we very slowly increase demands on concentration until you are proudly watching your karate kid earn a black belt after a few short years of training. This ability to focus, concentrate, and persevere directly transfers to schoolwork and many other areas of life.

ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE & BEHAVIOR IMPROVEMENTS
With most children’s activities, the learning stops when the activity ends. Our goal is to teach children how to take the life skills we teach and put them to use in their lives at home and in school. Our “patch & star” reward program will help you reinforce our lessons at home and at school. Because our program is karate-based, we are proud to help children learn the values of discipline, courtesy, respect, and self-control. Using our weekly progress reports, you can continue the lessons at home in a fun and exciting way. Each time your karate kid turns in a positive homework sheet, we reward him/her in front of the entire class, helping reinforce good behavior!

We also understand that sometimes our children have trouble displaying these values. So if your child needs a little extra parental support, we’re here to work side-by-side with you, to make sure your child is right on track!

DISCIPLINE & FITNESS
A byproduct of training in Martial Arts is better coordination because Taekwondo challenges the entire body, developing balance, agility, and poise, qualities that are often neglected in many team sports available to this age group. Karate for Kids also uses karate-based exercises such as blocking, striking, and kicking in a fun, structured setting to teach a positive attitude toward exercise.";"N/A";"N/A";"KickBoxing";"N/A";"http://leesatamember.com/locations/tempe/";"Monday: 12:00 PM - 8:00 PM

Our Kids program is one of our most successful classes at  Siege MMA! This class is perfect for kids of all sizes and experience levels. We offer classes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (where we also incorporate wrestling) and competition boxing.

If your child is looking to compete, then you've checked out the right website, as we have one of the best kids competition teams in the state! Our team consists of kids who, in Brazilian-Jiu-Jitsu, are multiple time State Champions, National Champions, and even World Champions! In fact, this past year in the 2014 Kids World Championships of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in California, we took a small group of only 13 kids where 10 of those 13  medaled, and 7 of the 10 who medaled took GOLD!

As much as we love watching our kids win tournaments, we equally love seeing them grow in confidence. We've had countless stories of kids who have been able to stand up against bullies and even defend themselves, when necessary, using what they've learned at Siege MMA. We've even seen kids who are more quiet break out of their shells and become leaders, doing things like leading warm ups and even helping beginners.

Our Kids team is coached by Jesus Jose, a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt under Giva ""The Arm Collector"" Santana, Kamuela ""The Jawaiian"" Kirk, an undefeated Professional MMA fighter and 2-time Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu World Champion, and Rob Garcia, professional Boxing and Muay Thai coach.

United Kung Fu specializes in teaching traditional Kung Fu with modern applications. Kung Fu is an ancient Chinese Martial Art and self-cultivation system. The phrase “Kung Fu” translates as “hard work”, “time and effort” or you might call it “sweat time”. The practice of Kung Fu was originally conceived by the Buddhist Monks in the Honan Province of Northern China. Its roots date back thousands of years, and it was initially developed as a way to discipline the mind and body, encompassing a wide range of martial arts styles and techniques over time.

At United Kung Fu, we train Positive Minds and Healthy Bodies to help our students achieve the highest level of success in their Kung Fu, and in their lives. Training Kung Fu helps students gain the modern day advantages they need to achieve success, well-being and balance. This means that our students learn the martial arts and self-defense aspects of Kung Fu as well as improving confidence, self-respect, focus, awareness, flexibility, strength, coordination, health and wellness.


United Kung Fu has been helping people in the valley reach their goals through the study of Kung Fu since 1996. The United Kung Fu Curriculum encompasses an amazing variety of martial arts styles, such as:

 

    Southern Shaolin Tiger and Crane
    Northern Shaolin Long Fist
    Xing Yi
    Ba Gua
    Wing Chun
    Yang Style Tai Chi

    50 weapon forms

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art and the easiest way to describe it is that it was developed in order for a smaller person to properly defend themselves against a larger opponent. A man named Mitsuyo Maeda, or Conde Koma, came from Japan and ended up staying on a farm in Brazil. This farm happened to belong to a family named Gracie. He taught Carlos Gracie Sr, the eldest son, Jiu-Jitsu, and in turn Carlos Sr developed a new style and techniques to make its applications beneficial to smaller people. Thus the genesis of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

While self-defense has always been the driving focus behind BJJ, and will be covered in many different aspects in our class from Early Achievers to Adults, we have been going through an evolution process in ways and benefits that training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provides. Especially for those that are growing up. However, it is also one of the few sport activities that people can competitively continue well into the later years of life.
For kids they learn teamwork, discipline, and self-esteem. More importantly they will build the courage to stand up for themselves, the honor to stand up for those who can’t, and the strength to keep standing even in the most trying times. They will learn the most important value of self-worth. For the parents you get the peace of mind knowing your child is on their way to becoming able to take care of themselves beginning on a small scale.
For adults this is a fantastic way to improve overall health. It will increase your energy levels no matter where you are: home, work, leisure. You will feel better and able to do and enjoy more with your day. This is a great stress reducing activity by being able to work out frustration while bonding and developing relationships with other students who are sharing similiar interests. Like minded individuals coming together in order to achieve the same goal of better enjoying their life.
For families we take time off the mats to continue these values. We offer workshops on bike safety, emergency safety procedures, science projects, reading, and more. We also have scavenger hunts and trips to the park for specialized strength and conditioning sessions to further the bonding experience between family and team members.
BJJ is a great way to get in shape and feel confident and once someone feels confident the limits of what they can achieve is beyond anything they previously imagined. We use the ethos courage, honor, and strength to guide this gym. Everything from the curriculum to how we conduct ourselves off the mats. Make the choice to try BJJ for yourself and see the improvements firsthand because whether here or at another school the benefits of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the chance to make anyone’s life better.";"http://chsbjj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CHS-BJJ-Logo-300px.png";"http://chsbjj.com/classes/#elementary";"Once a student is enrolled into the Courage Program we start to increase the workload.

Childhood attitudes toward fitness take root early

The lessons your child learns now about physical fitness may very well follow them into adulthood.

Martial arts instruction teaches kids about their bodies. They learn to push themselves and pursue fitness goals.

Studying martial arts sets kids up for good health and a healthy body image that they’ll keep throughout their lives.



Obesity leads to health problems and low self-esteem

Martial arts Instruction provides two essential elements for weight loss: cardiovascular activity and core and muscle toning.

We work with kids who need to lose weight by providing them with achievable goals.

Our focus on self-discipline helps kids understand that what they do affects their bodies, and helps them to lose weight and get in shape.

"Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Scottsdale";"http://graciescottsdale.com/";" +1 480-946-0380";"7901 E Thomas Rd";"Scottsdale";"AZ";85257;;"United States";"True Effectiveness
In the beginning, there were no tournaments associated with the practice of Gracie (Brazilian) Jiu-Jitsu. The dangerous and unforgiving “street” fight was the only testing ground. In 1967, the first Federation of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was established in order to give practitioners the opportunity to test their skills in a safe setting. The fun and excitement of competition, coupled with the prestige that accompanied tournament victories, drove the vast majority of instructors to focus entirely on preparing their students for the jiu-jitsu game. This shift away from jiu-jitsu for self defense had a profound impact on the practice of the martial art.

The Philosophical Difference
While nearly all Brazilian jiu-jitsu schools succumbed to the lure of tournament glory, the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy remained true to the practice of techniques that would work in a real fight. The Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy training objective was, and remains to this day, to enable practitioners to defeat an all-out attack from a larger and more athletic opponent. In comparison, the sport jiu-jitsu objective is to win against an opponent of similar size in a closely-monitored and controlled match. The fundamental philosophical difference between street self-defense and tournament competition affects all aspects of jiu-jitsu training and mindset.

The Technical Difference
Several hundred techniques will work both in a tournament match or a street fight. But, the complete Gracie Jiu-Jitsu curriculum also contains many techniques that were developed exclusively for street fight scenarios with no applicability in competition. The problem is that most Brazilian jiu-jitsu schools have totally eliminated the “street only” techniques from their programs in order to allow more training time for techniques that will lead to victory under the point-based system, rules, and weight classes of sport jiu-jitsu tournaments. This technical difference between the Gracie Academy curriculum and other Brazilian jiu-jitsu programs reflects the philosophical difference between street self-defense and sport competition and carries over to the award of belts as measures of proficiency in the system.

The Belt Difference
The Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy belt system is distinct from that of sport-oriented schools. Although the belt colors are the same, the belt qualification requirements are very different. Sport-oriented schools promote students based exclusively on their mastery of techniques that will lead to victory in a tournament setting. In most cases, sport belt holders are very comfortable in sport jiu-jitsu matches and controlled sparring sessions. However, when confronted by a larger and more athletic opponent who doesn’t play by the rules, they are often shaken by the unpredictable, violent attack and find themselves unable to respond.

At the Gracie Academy, belt promotions are based, first and foremost, on the student’s mastery of the techniques that will ensure victory in a street fight. The Academy rigorously tests each student’s skills and reflexes at each stage of their training. The Gracie Academy Blue Belt Qualification Test, for example, requires students to demonstrate a high level of accuracy, efficiency, and reflexes in the execution of the most important street self-defense techniques. Because we feel that “street readiness” is our first and foremost objective, most of the techniques that we teach from white to blue belt are “street only”. As a result, a Gracie Academy blue belt will win on the street but may not fare well in a sport jiu-jitsu match. On the other hand, a sport jiu-jitsu blue belt will perform well on the mat, but may have difficulty dealing with unpredictable and chaotic circumstances of a real fight.

Above everything else, a certified Gracie Jiu-Jitsu belt holder can be certain that his knowledge will serve him when he needs it most- in a real fight against a larger, more athletic opponent.";"http://graciescottsdale.com/wp-scottsdale/uploads/2013/12/GracieLogo.png";"http://graciescottsdale.com/bullyproof/";"Every month in the United States, three million children miss school due to fear of bullies. In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 13.

To read a touching story about how the Gracie Bullyproof program saved a 12-year-old boy after only one week of training, click here.

We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one.

The Saito Jujitsu Edge is what you’ll need to become a UFC/MMA champion. It is what you'll need to become a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Champion.  Why is this so?  Now more than ever to win requires superior skill and knowledge.  How is this attainable?  Master Maui Saito has been studying the historically authentic and full combative Japanese Jujitsu for more that forty years, the same Jujitsu the Gracie’s have been studying and teaching and calling their own, only more.  The roots of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is authentic Japanese Jujitsu and brings excellent focus on a portion of the art, but there is still much more knowledge to advance further.  More must be attained for fighters today to have the competitive edge. and win!
Master Maui Saito learned Japanese Jujitsu from his father, the Great Grand Master Mark Saito, Sr.  The Great Grand Master Mark Saito, Sr., learned Japanese Jujitsu from his Grandfather, the Great Grand Master Hanshichi Saito.  The Great Grand Master Hanshichi Saito is pure Japanese and was born and raised in Fukushima Valley, Japan.   Each generation of the Saito clan has passed on the original unwatered-down combative art predating the peace time period of Japan's history.  It is Pure Authentic Japanese Jujitsu from Great Grandfather - to father - to son. 

In our school you will learn everything Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, everything Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and everything Japanese Jujitsu.  More importantly, you will learn escapes and reversals from all of the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu moves, especially their favorites; and escapes and reversals from all of the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu favorites.  Okay, that was really important, important enough for me to say it again…

You will learn escapes and reversals from all Gracie and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and more, including all combative JuJitsu.  That right there will be your BJJ competitive edge - that will be your UFC edge, to win your title fight!

The teaching ability of Master Maui Saito is unsurpassed, and his extensive knowledge and skills go beyond the realm and limits of Jujitsu as it is often taught.  He was immersed in a life time of martial arts education through his family line whose techniques were extensively long held in secrecy within the family lineage until the recent time.  The mark of true success, however, is whether a teacher can impart the same skills and ability to his students.  Many teachers, instructors, trainers have excelled competitively, but fail to become great teachers who can impart the same level of skill and success to their students, so those students can rise as far or even farther.  This important fact is crucial in determining the right place to train.  Is the success of the student the most important goal to your instructor, teacher, trainer?  Is that success meant for your own long term personal goals?  You will have no doubt, when you walk in and meet Master Maui Saito, of the intention to provide you with the highest quality and superior training that will make you more than great, and go beyond the levels you thought you could attain, whether a complete beginner or already in the highest leagues.

Jiu Jitsu is a life long journey, mine started in 2005 in Phoenix, AZ.  At the time I had just finished playing two years of Junior College Basketball and had just moved to Arizona.  I was working at Red Lobster while searching for what I wanted to do with my life.  One day a fellow server, Ray Elbe, told me that he was professional fighter and that I should go check out his gym.  I had been in some street fights and faired pretty well so I imagined I would go and be just fine.  After taking a beating and realizing how technical fighting is I felt that this would be a great hobby to fill the void of competition that was left after basketball. A hobby soon became and obsession and passion. 

I first started training at Arizona Center of Mixed Martial Arts under Elbe and the late Marc Zee.  I felt that Muay Thai kickboxing would be what really interest me, then I would take some Jiu Jitsu classes as well.  After about six months of training I found myself incredibly hungry to learn more Jiu Jitsu.  In 2006 I was awarded my Blue Belt.
At the Blue Belt level I felt I knew so much about Jiu Jitsu.  I started traveling and checking out a Lotus Club School, Siege MMA, out west of Phoenix.  I had been a Blue Belt for around two years, I felt I was ready for my Purple.  About that time Professor Ricardo Zanelato had came out from Brazil to teach at Siege MMA, I soon realized how little I knew.  I switched full time to Siege MMA under the tutelage of Zanelato and my Jiu Jitsu began to grow rapidly. In 2009 I received my Purple Belt from then Lotus Club Black Belt Juliano Prado.


As a Purple Belt I started teaching classes when needed and learned the value of teaching others.  I realized how difficult is was to break down Jiu Jitsu movements and then to teach it to others.  I spent most of my Purple Belt studying and teaching.  In late 2010 I received my Brown Belt from Professor Giva Santana.  I am very blessed to train under Santana, he is a 4th Degree Black Belt with some the best Jiu Jitsu in the world.  After receiving my Brown Belt I took an opportunity to teach at the World Renowned Tiger Muay Thai in Phuket, Thailand.  The opportunity was given to me by the same person who got me into Jiu Jitsu, Ray Elbe.  I was very fortunate to teach out there for six months and it gave me a new appreciation and respect for all that Jiu Jitsu does for me.  I was also able to train traditional Muay Thai and learn the history and traditions.

December 8, 2103 I was awarded my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt from Giva Santana.  Now that I am a Black Belt not much has changed as I am still thirsty to train, get better, and seek knowledge.

I currently continue my journey in Jiu Jitsu teaching, competing and learning everyday at De Boa BJJ and I am excited to see what Jiu Jitsu has in store for me next.";"https://www.deboabjj.com/uploads/1/0/4/3/10433031/1452894317.png";"https://www.deboabjj.com/kids-class.html";"Kids Jiu Jitsu, taught by Black Belt Instructor, Andrew Gardineer along with Brown Belts Leslie Gardineer, Andy Campa and Blue Belt Chris Cephis
Jiu Jitsu for kids:
Introducing a child to the world of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu  is an excellent way to ensure they will grow up with a strong foundation of patience, confidence and discipline. While some parents are hesitant to get their child involved in any contact sports, the art of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is far gentler than you might think. Your child is more likely to be injured in a playground unsupervised than they would under the care and direction of a good instructor.

Jiu Jitsu is great for team building, conflict resolution, respect, self defense and self discipline!

";"https://www.deboabjj.com/ladies-class.html";"Brazilian Jiu Jitsu helps women avoid dangerous situations and empowers them with simple escape techniques. It is designed to help a woman save herself from her attacker, whether she is on her feet or on the ground. 

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu involves submission and ground fighting techniques. It focuses on gaining a dominant position over your opponent with the help of techniques such as chokeholds, joint-locks, compression lock, etc. Most martial arts need the practitioners to be physically strong to face a heavy-weight opponent. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu needs more of body mechanisms rather than strength, speed and weight of the person practicing it. They can therefore be used effectively by anyone of any age, size, strength or level of physical fitness.

A common way for men to win a fight over women is to knock her down to the ground and control the whole situation. The ground fighting techniques of the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu focuses on acting against your opponent with your back on ground plus taking the advantage of the right situations and poses of the opponent.

It's also great for losing weight, getting in shape and feeling confident and empowered!";"N/A";"N/A";"https://www.deboabjj.com/programsschedule.html";"N/A";"Andrew Gardineer";"N/A";"lotussurprise@yahoo.com";"https://www.facebook.com/deboabjj/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkAx0kFoF_9H3piegv_vaHg";"N/A";"N/A";"No";

History
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art, combat sport & a self-defense system that focuses on grappling & especially ground fighting. It promotes the principle that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique—most notably by applying joint-locks & choke holds  to defeat the other person. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu can be trained for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) &  mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self-defense. Sparring (commonly referred to as 'rolling') & live drilling play a major role in training, & a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition.

Dear Fellow Parent‍,

I don’t blame you for being skeptical.

Frankly, if I didn’t see it for myself (nearly every day) I wouldn’t believe it either.

I mean really…..how is it possible that a Martial Arts Program can develop your child’s focus, self-esteem, self-confidence, and overall sense of purpose the way NO OTHER sport, hobby, “activity,” or program can?

Hi, my name is M‍‍‍aster Jerry Laurita

And I’m very PROUD to say that HUNDREDS of parents and families in the Avondale area are singing the praises of our Children’s Martial Arts program and telling other parents about it every day, because they’ve seen it for themselves, too.

We all want the best for our children, but our world today has other intentions.

With all the violence on TV, short attention span programming, the challenges in our education system, and how busy our ‍‍‍families are, where is your child going to be surrounded by POSITIVE, enthusiastic peers and towering role models?

Avondale, Goodyear and Litchfield Park parents tell us that our instructors become like “superheroes” to their children, providing them with the type of inspiration and direction they truly need to accomplish their goals, and live a clean, happy, healthy lifestyle.


Develop a Winning ‍‍‍Spirit!

I’m sure you’ve heard that, “It’s not how many times you get knocked down in life that counts, but how many times you get back up.” Martial Arts instills a winning spirit, the spirit to overcome adversity and to rise to the challenge.

When your child trains at Sentosa Martial Arts, they will face many challenges and learn to overcome them. They will develop the winning spirit, which will become a habit, and help them overcome ANY challenge in their life.
    Is your child sometimes disrespectful? 

Our innovative children’s Martial Arts program teaches respect for all adults, but especially parents and teachers.

    Does your child misbehave? 

Our students develop SELF-discipline so they are better behaved and can focus on their schoolwork and chores at home without getting easily distracted. Even children with ADD and ADHD develop better focus.

    Is your child a little too shy‍‍‍? 

Our martial arts program builds confidence so that as your child progresses in rank, he or she will learn to speak up and actually become a leader.


Build Out‍‍‍standing Character!

Martial Arts training also develops character in the students, with emphasis on courtesy, integrity, perseverance, and self-control.

Parents love our martial arts classes over other sports because of the character-building lessons emphasized in every class. Your children will practice courtesy with improved behavior at your home and at school. They’ll learn to admire those with integrity, like their instructors, and strive to develop integrity in all their actions.

Your children will also learn perseverance in pursuit of their physical skills, and that will translate to perseverance in their schoolwork and to perseverance in other goals they may set in their lives. The self-control practiced in their Martial Arts class also results in better behavior for your children at school and greater resistance to negative peer pressure.";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay Thai Kickboxing";"N/A";"http://www.sentosamartialarts.com/adults-schedule

While largely based on Taiho-Jutsu (the style currently used by the Japanese police force), the style itself encompasses techniques and katas (forms) from many different styles including jujitsu, kempo, taekwondo, and aikido. Taiho-Ryu also includes the study of classical martial arts weapons such as bo, tonfa, nunchaku, sai, and katana (sword).

Taiho-Ryu differs from most martial arts being offered today in the fact that it is a practical style with emphasis in what works rather than what looks good. Training centers around tradition with kata, mind and breath control, discipline, philosophy and history. Training also includes the conditioning of both mind and body, and of self-defense including defense against grabs, throws, gun and knife, and multiple person attacks.

The ranking system in Taiho-Ryu is designated by belt color, starting with white, then yellow, blue, green, purple, brown, and then the ascending degrees of black. Holders of a degree in kobujutsu (study of weapons) are designated with a red stripe on the belt. Testing is permitted when the instructor feels that the student is ready for the next rank. Generally, if a student trains hard and is regular in attendance, testing may be as often as every six to eight months, depending on the rank being obtained. There are no stripes between belts--graduation is between the colors listed above only.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://www.taiho-ryu.org/, Schools Tab";"N/A";"Bo Hardy";"N/A";"contact3@taiho-ryu.org";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"No";

    Arm your child to succeed in life?
    Help them be the best they can be in school?
    Develop their self confidence?
    Assist them in developing their unique potential?
    Learn self-discipline?

Most parents do everything they can to teach these things to their children, but after school many parents need some help. The 2-4 hours that kids spend after school before their parents get home are some of the most important hours in a child's life.

How is your child spending their time After School? Let’s look at this example: The average child spends 3-4 hours somewhere after school before their parents come home. A child in 1st to 7th grade spends about 200 days in school out of the year; this doesn’t even include the 8 hours a day for 2-3 months during the summer. 200 days times 3 hours is 600 hours a year a child spends doing what?

Some go to babysitters.

Some go home and play with their friends doing whatever they want.

Others get into serious trouble.

Not Our Students.

Between the 1st and 7th grade a child spends an average of 4200 hours doing basically nothing productive. This time is more valuable than you know. In 4200 hours you could graduate from college, get your Masters Degree and your Ph.D. So why wouldn’t you let your child spend this valuable time learning skills that will last a lifetime?

When our kids get out of school, their parents know that their child is being trained in real Life Skills. With our busy 21st century schedules, it's hard to find the time and resources to really help them with these important life skills. You would think and expect that they would learn about perseverance, positive mental attitudes, self-discipline and goal setting in school, but they really don't. Students who attend 10th Planet Los Angeles Academy have an advantage over others because we teach them about these important life skills and how to develop them to their fullest! They learn success traits that will pay off for the rest of their lives.

If you have a 5 to 13-year-old looking for something to do after school, look no further. 10th Planet Los Angeles Mixed Martial Arts After School program will provide your child with structured study time, lessons in Martial Arts, stranger danger, anger management, conflict resolution, 911 awareness, fire safety, and much more. In one of the finest facilities in the country, your child will learn life lessons that will assure a future of success. Wouldn't it be nice to have your child enrolled in a program that is committed to keeping children away from drugs and gangs?

We understand how important it is to instill these character skills in children at a young age.

 There are many different types of Martial Arts out there, which can be hard to really understand the differences between styles when you are trying to choose what would be best for your child. Here are several reasons why Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is one of the safest forms for children to begin their journey into the world of martial arts:

– It is a non-violent, yet effective and complete self-defense system. Many parents want their child to learn a martial art in order to defend herself/himself against bullies or unwanted strangers. Having a safe and systematic foundation of self-defense is key for children to feel confident, specifically about defending themselves, if necessary. Since it is completely based in leverage and submission, BJJ technique actually gives the smaller opponent an advantage. There is no kicking or punching involved, unlike many other martial arts.

– It is a natural martial art, based on leverage and balance. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu uses the principles of action – reaction, leverage, and base. Children learn to use an opponent’s power as an advantage, rather than fighting against the force. We practice many different games that help children experience these principles and learn to understand how to use them as techniques. Children develop a heightened sense of body awareness and coordination, which leads to self-confidence and inner discipline. Not only do children learn how to effectively defend themselves, but also strengthen their kinesthetic abilities to excel in any other sport of which they participate. It doesn’t have to be a choice of one sport or the other

BENEFITS OF COBRINHA BRAZILIAN JIU-JITSU 

Self-Defense – Your child will learn real-world techniques that will help them to defend themselves in difficult situations. Brazilian jiu-jitsu’s focus is to teach students who are smaller and weaker to defend themselves against a larger, stronger assailant. While we teach students that the first choice is to avoid conflict all together, we will prepare them with the skills required to protect themselves in situations that cannot be avoided.

 

Fitness – The stamina and endurance children develop during Martial Arts training in our Kids Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program results in natural weight-loss and an improvement in overall physical and mental health.

 

Balance and Motor Skills – Jiu-Jitsu is a sport known to teach balance and good coordination. Our Kid’s Program focuses on creating good hand and eye coordination when learning the techniques, especially while training with their drilling partners. They will learn the importance of paying attention to their surroundings. We have found that children who train Jiu-Jitsu for a long period of time gain great posture and motor skills, which assists in the development of becoming flexible and in-tune with their own bodies.

 

 Self-Confidence – Your child will naturally gain self-confidence as they work their way through the belt system and progress. Our belt system provides children measurable goals to follow that are realistic to attain. Your child will gain a sense of self-accomplishment by mastering new techniques and earning belts that will follow them throughout their life.

 

Self-Discipline – Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instills mental focus in your child. Your child will learn how to concentrate on learning a technique while seeing it through, but there is much more than that. We want to make sure that our students are working on their Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu technique, improving their behavior at home, as well as improving their grades at school. We teach a very effective form of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and want to make sure that the every kid is learning it correctly.

 

Respect – The way that we have our Kid’s program structured, we have found that creating a foundation of respect and discipline not only benefits the students on the mat, but also off the mat. As a World Champion Training Facility, we strive not only for great competitors, but also for great individuals. It is necessary for our young children to learn respect and become disciplined to succeed on the mat, at home and in school. All of our students are disciplined to treat others as they would like to be treated, becoming positive influences everywhere they go. We will also continuously impress upon your child the importance to show respect to parents, teachers and peers in their every day lives.

 

Teamwork, Positive Social Interaction and Bully-Proofing – Jiu-Jitsu is a sport meant for teamwork, where we teach our kids to encourage and motivate one another to become better in everything that they do. In particular, we educate them about bullying and how to better deal with situations that involve bullying. Every student is encouraged to build one another up and not bring on another down. We find it very important for all of our kids to understand and put into practice a positive social environment within a team.

 

Smile, Laugh and Have Fun – At the end of the day, we want our kid’s to have fun and become positive individuals. Jiu-Jitsu can take a lot of physical and mental strength, so with the rewards they can gain through hard work, it’s all worth it in the end. Our instructors have placed certain activities in their training to let them smile and laugh, but most importantly… be a kid!";"N/A";"N/A";"Sub Grappling";"N/A";"http://www.cobrinhabjj.com/schedule/#not-set:all";"Monday: 9:00 AM - 9:40 PM

After studying martial arts for the majority of their lives, both men felt that it was time for the next phase in their martial arts journey—passing on the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their respective careers. They decided to merge their complementary expertise into a single, cohesive system and open a training center where they could teach all aspects of modern combat sports, using the most effective and efficient techniques and concepts.

Together, Henry and Antoni formed Dynamix, where people from all walks of life come together to reach their fitness and martial arts goals; from beginner level students interested in learning fundamental techniques and self-defense, to professional fighters seeking to perfect their discipline for competition at the highest levels.

In 2012, long time friend and training partner, Vladimir Matyushenko joined the coaching staff and thus completed the MMA curriculum by adding his wrestling expertise to Antoni’s Kickboxing and Henry’s Jiu-Jitsu, forming a complete system of fighting education.
The name “Dynamix” is based on the scientific term “Dynamics”. The founders of Dynamix MMA found that “Dynamics” was the perfect term to describe their teachings. Just like the scientific application, the martial arts curriculum taught at Dynamix also represent the correlation between forces and bodies in motion—however in this context, the emphasis is on human bodies in motion.

It began as a small idea that over time has grown into an impactful martial arts movement helping children, adults and families to discover this beautiful art.

LEVEL UP BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU

After 30 years of teaching, training, and competing around the world, Professor Erik Klinger the main founder of Level Up Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, had formed a specific vision of the way he thought martial arts should be taught and delivered to students and the public. Through his vision, Level Up Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was born. The belief and movement itself can be described in the Level Up core statement of purpose, “Through great teaching and great service, we can see great change in the world.” This embodies the true goals of the Level Up philosophy and vision to have world class teaching and classes for children and adults and to deliver a service unparalleled to students, parents, and families looking to better themselves, their community and in fact, the world.

Level Up Brazilian Jiu Jitsu’s first location in the U.S. is open today in West Los Angeles, California on Santa Monica Blvd. and provides traditional Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes for children as young as 3 years old and adults as old or young as you can imagine. Classes are divided by age and are taught based on a standard curriculum developed and perfected to bring an appropriate experience to each student based on their martial arts experience, level, age, and ability. A second location for Jiu Jitsu and martial arts in Studio City was opened in 2017 and is growing in the area of Toluca Lake, Sherman Oaks, Hollywood Hills, and Studio City on Ventura Blvd. Level Up has grown to four more locations internationally, in Brazil and Guatemala where children and adults enjoy the Level Up philosophy and training methods.

Are you looking for Kids Martial Arts in West Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Westwood, or Brentwood areas? You have found the right place for your child!

The LEVEL UP Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu West Los Angeles and Martial Arts program Santa Monica Blvd, is perfect for children in Kindergarten through Elementary school ages who are beginning to learn more about themselves and the world. In this program kids are taught how to be focused, disciplined, confident, and also how to defend themselves.

BULLY BASICS

In addition to mindset skills taught in class your child will be able to physically defend themselves if needed. They will learn the basics of bully prevention including using their words correctly, building their confidence, and also real life self defense skills that really work.
What is the Difference between Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Kids Karate, Kids Tae Kwon do and other Kids Martial Arts in West Los Angeles?

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu works without having to throw any strike, punch or kick at an opponent. Your child will be able to escape a physical confrontation at school or when confronted by a bully anywhere if needed, without having to hit another child or strike them in any way whatsoever. This is the one of the main differences between Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes here at LEVEL UP West Los Angeles and many other Martial Arts, Karate, and Tae Kwon Do schools in Los Angeles which teach children how to punch or kick another child who is bothering them or confronting them. The benefit of the Level Up Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu program is that children are encouraged to use words before using their martial arts skills. If their words do not work they will also be able to defend themselves using leverage, positioning, and control from their newly aquired Brazilian Jiu Jitsu skills.

You will love the fun, active, and fast pace of the Kids Jiu Jitsu classes in West LA here at LEVEL UP. Parents rave about the attention given to kids, and the fast pace of classes which keep kids engaged, enjoying, and coming back for more.

Through his basketball training buddies, Diogo heard about the Gracie family and their achievements in jiu jitsu, some time after Rey first heard about the Gracie family, he went to a cock fighting event where he met Carlson Gracie (who was a huge cock fighting fan). After he got to know Carlson, he was invited to come and train at the Carlson Gracie Academy, Ricardo Diogo was 19 years old at the time. Rey Diogo became part of the famous Carlson Gracie team sharing the mats with champions such as Ricardo De La Riva, Amaury Bitetti, Ricardo Liborio and many others.

Jiu Jitsu & Muay Thai work because of leverage & physics. They also require hard work and lots of sweat. No shortcuts, no secret death touches. Just real hands on martial arts, real benefits, real skills, and real fun!

Martial Arts & Fitness are the mediums we use to accomplish many other goals in our program, but are singularly important for children’s well-being.

BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU IS

    A grappling Martial Art.
    Commonly accepted as THE MOST EFFECTIVE martial art for self-defense.
    Developed so that a smaller person can overcome the power of a larger attacker using leverage.
    A highly intellectual and physically demanding martial art.
    Has taken the world by storm since it edged out all other Martial Arts in the early days of Mixed Martial Arts(MMA – as seen in the UFC and other leagues).

MUAY THAI IS

    A striking art that focuses on punches, kicks and knee/elbow strikes.
    Widely considered the most effective striking Martial Art.
    Considered an integral part of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).
    Practiced by all professional fighters in the UFC and other MMA leagues.

OUR FIVE TENANTS

1) MENTAL TOUGHNESS

Mental Toughness means moving forward in the face of adversity. Physical education is one of the best platforms for learning how to confront challenges in life with a successful attitude. Here are some of the mental toughness concepts we explore:

    How to develop Mental Toughness through practice.
    How to accept challenges instead of avoiding them.
    How to become aware of internal dialogue when facing adversity.
    How to change internal dialogue to help face challenges confidently.
    How to be self-reliant and how to use support systems (coaches, friends, family) when needed.

2) PROPER BODY ALIGNMENT AND MOVEMENT

Proper Body Alignment & Movement Patterns are the foundations of good athletics performance, injury prevention and healthy bodies. If your child learns real body awareness and how to move correctly, they will be able to translate those skills into all sports and physical endeavors. Here are some of the concepts we explore with the children in our program:

    What good posture really means.
    How to walk and run efficiently and properly.
    How to properly fall and keep one’s body safe.
    How to safely get the maximum power out of one’s muscles & body structure.

3) HEALTHY COMMUNICATION

Communicating Responsibly is paramount for team work as well as simply getting what we need. Proper communication is a fundamental part of our physical experience and is addressed in all our activities. Here are some of the communication concepts we explore:

    How to introduce yourself and speak to people respectfully
    Taking responsibility for our feelings,
    Differentiating between “needs” and “wants,”
    Communicating our needs properly.
4) THE ART OF LEARNING

The Art of Learning is the perhaps the most important skill kids can develop here. Students will learn the process of improving a skill, how to approach complex problems, how to move through challenging phases and witness the joy and satisfaction their hard work brings. Some Art of Learning concepts we cover include:

    Recognizing the relationship between intentional practice and results.
    Using losses/setbacks as a tool for improvement.
    Fixed Mentality vs Growth Mentality.
    Pattern recognition (aka “chunking”) & problem solving.

4) TRUST

In any martial art, kids practice potentially dangerous movements with peers and adults. Trust is required to safely perform these movements, which is necessary to progress and learn.

    Trust is a fundamental aspect of communication
    Kids learn to trust adults as role models and as resources
    Trust is required to be a good partner
    How to give trust in order to receive it

What is Kids Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is THE BEST non-violent self defense for children and teens. Children learn takedowns, falling, controls, and at the older ages, “tap-outs.” In the day-to-day classes, we take the punching/kicking element out of the equation and focus mainly on grappling. Through demonstration, students learn a series of techniques each day. After thorough preparation, our students implement the new technique in a controlled and supervised sparring session, where they have the opportunity to practice techniques against a resisting opponent. Because we have removed dangerous punches and kicks from our training, students can spar during each training session, increasing their proficiency in the sport with each class. Kids of every age enjoy grappling and learning how to use their moves with their peers.


What to Expect on the First Day

Many children (and some teens too!) may feel very reserved, nervous, and shy on their first day, as is the case with many new activities. There will be many new movements and positions that are completely foreign to them. It is completely natural to feel timid, but after a few minutes of instruction, participants are encouraged by the supportive environment and tend to relax. Our goal at the beginning of class is to make the warm-ups fast-paced and fun. We encourage every child join in, with or without the uniform, to get a feel for the class. Some children prefer to watch at first, which they are welcome to do. We do not require sparring or competition in the class, but most kids look forward to trying their new techniques. We end each class with fun, cooperative games, which are always a hit with the kids.

Carlos Gracie was interested in street self-defense, and quickly modified the classical techniques he learned from Count Koma to meet the demands of real, ""no rules"" fighting in the streets of Brazil. The young Carlos Gracie then tested and refined his system through constant matches, open to all comers, constantly working to make it more effective. He even advertised in newspapers and on street corners for new opponents upon whom to practice and further refine his art. He fought anyone and everyone who was willing, regardless of size, weight or fighting style. Even though he was a mere 135 pounds, his style was so effective that Carlos Gracie was never defeated and became a legend in Brazil.

This tradition of open challenge is a part of the heritage of the Gracie style of jiu-jitsu. Carlos Gracie taught his style of jiu-jitsu to his four younger brothers (Oswaldo, Gastão, Jorge and Helio) and to his older sons (including Carlson and Carley), and they in turn taught their brothers, sons, nephews and cousins. After Carlos retired from the ring, he managed the fight careers of his brothers and sons, continuing to challenge fighters of all styles throughout the world. This tradition of open challenge has been continued by his sons, grandsons, brothers, nephews, and students, who have consistently demonstrated the superiority of the Gracie style in real fights and minimum-rule matches in rings throughout the world.

Carlos Gracie had 21 children and his youngest brother Helio had 7 sons, creating a virtual dynasty of Gracie fighters and instructors who dominated the world of ""no rules"" fight contests and whose techniques and strategies permeate the MMA world today. In these events, Gracie representatives have consistently demonstrated, in open competition against title holders from other martial arts styles, that the Gracie style of jiu-jitsu is the most effective fighting art in the world today. No small wonder that the Gracie style of jiu-jitsu is the ""hottest"" item in martial arts today.";"http://www.carleygracie.com/images/CGLogo-bcard.png";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Kickboxing";"N/A";"http://www.carleygracie.com/index.php/classes";"N/A";"Carley Gracie";"N/A";"academy@carleygracie.com";"https://www.facebook.com/CarleyGracieJiuJitsu/";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"No";

Maeda was able to get himself established with the help of a local business man, Gastão Gracie, and out of gratitude Maeda taught Gastão’s oldest son Carlos Jiu-Jitsu.

Carlos Gracie was interested in the practical application of what he had learned in the “anything goes” environment of the street and refined Maeda’s techniques through numerous challenge matches. Carlos even took out an add in the local paper challenging all comers to fight regardless of their size or physical advantages.  At a mere 135 pounds Carlos was able to utilize his technique to overcome all opponents and was never defeated.

The refinement of technique through actual competition and the willingness to fight any challenger have become part of the Gracie family tradition.

Gracie Jiu-Jitsu has turned the martial arts world upside down by emphasizing real-life situations and results over the dramatic kicks and throws of formal competition, making it also one of the most effective self-defense techniques for non-athletes. This guide to the self-defense techniques taught in the classes of Royce Gracie, one of the biggest figures in the world of jiu-jitsu, provides lessons that anyone—regardless of strength or size—can learn to neutralize an attacker in seconds. It offers a variety of defenses to use against knife and gun attacks, as well as escapes from headlocks, choke holds, and other situations that attackers use on the street. Advice on practicing and falling and rolling make this book the next best thing to taking the classes that are popular with the United States military, police academies, and women's self-defense schools.


Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is a system of one-on-one ground fighting, where the objective is to achieve a superior position for joint locks, chokes and strikes. Some Historians say that Jiu-Jitsu is the oldest form of martial art having originated in India more than 2,000 years before Christ. It was originally thought to have been developed by Buddhist Monks. Concerned with self-defense, these monks created techniques based upon principles of balance and leverage, and a system of manipulating the body in a manner where one could avoid relying upon strength or weapons.


With the expansion of Buddhism, Jiu-Jitsu spread from Southeast Asia to China, finally arriving in Japan where it developed and gained further popularity. However, with the passing of the Tokugawa era (ca. 1800), Japan became somewhat united and there were many changes in Japanese society. One of the results of these changes was the reduction of the Samurai warrior to the status of the common citizen. In his new position, the Samurai could no longer carry a sword. He was forced to rely solely on empty-handed techniques as a means of defending himself. Over the years, since the reforms imposed by the Meiji restoration in Japan in the 1900s, Jiu-Jitsu became practically extinct in that country surviving only as a very restricted sportive form of Judo.



Evidence also shows us that Jiu-Jitsu techniques, although not necessarily under that name at the time, were included with warrior training in several countries circa 1100AD. In the last days of 19th century, some Jiu-Jitsu masters emigrated from Japan to other continents, teaching the martial arts, as well as competing in fights and competitions.


Esai Maeda Koma, also known as ""Conde Koma,"" was one such master. After traveling with a troupe who fought in various countries in Europe and the Americas, Koma arrived in Brazil in 1914 to help establish a Japanese immigration colony in that developing country, where he met a man named Gastao Gracie, a Brazilian scholar and politician of Scottish decent. Esai Maeda was aided in that endeavor by Gastao Gracie. The father of eight children, among then five boys and three girls, Gastao became a Jiu-Jitsu enthusiast and to show his gratitude to Gastao, the Japanese Jiu-Jitsu Master Esai Koma taught the basic secrets of that ancient fighting style to Gastao's oldest son, Carlos Gracie.
";"http://www.graciesf.com/files/images.png";"http://www.graciesf.com/kids.html";"News reports have reported conclusively over the last couple of years that the threat of bullying in schools has risen dramatically. Books, articles, and even TV shows, in recent years, talk about the increase in intimidation by kids against other kids in schools throughout the world. Furthermore, when parents try to do something on their own about what's happening to their child, they are the ones who get in trouble. What are they to do? The answer could simply be to change their child from the ""target"" list the bully has to the ""let's leave him/her alone"" list. What social scientists know is why bullies pick on certain kids. The bully knows they simply cannot defend themselves. When a bully knows someone is not an easy target for intimidation the bully avoids them.

 

  Many parents have turned to Martial Arts like Tae Kwon Do and Karate or Kung Fu which are, known as ""striking"" sports. However, to practice such sports, teachers must restrict the practice to ""non-contact"" forms, which diminishes their effectiveness if they have to be used in the real world. Secondly, kicking and punching are much less effective when the opponent is a bigger person.

 

  In the last 10 to 20 years, one form of martial art has emerged above all others (including all striking sports) as the single most effective means of self-defense among ALL forms of self-defense. That art is called Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Because Jiu-Jitsu is what is called a ""submission"" art, it can be easily learned by the student with low risk of injury. Just as important, by its techniques, Jiu-Jitsu is specifically is designed to allow the smaller person to defend themselves against the larger person with low risk.

 

  Grand Master Carlos Gracie, the Grandfather of Charles Gracie, used to run an advertisement to attract the toughest men in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) to fight him. He did this specifically to test the art of self-defense his family was developing. Carlos Gracie weighed about 140 pounds and never lost fighting men who outweighed him by 50 pounds or more. Decades later his grandnephew Royce Gracie would defeat professional fighters in the UFC who outweighed him by more than that. How could this be? Because Jiu-Jitsu is real. It works!

 

How does Jiu-Jitsu work?

  It eliminates fear because in learning Jiu-Jitsu a student learns techniques that enable them to not only defend themselves but to overcome any opponent. Bullies can see, through the opponent's reaction to their intimidation, whether a child is a target or not. Because the child gains invaluable knowledge of how to defend themselves that look of intimidation is replaced with one of self confidence. Also, in the Jiu-Jitsu classes themselves, every student competes against much larger students and so the fear of ""someone is bigger than me"" becomes a non issue to them.

 

  As we have progressed and evolved our curriculum, we have added classes in street self defense techniques for kids as well as introduction to mixed martial arts techniques for kids. If you are concerned about your own child capacity to defend themselves, in or out of school, there is a way to solve that problem and, at the same time, dramatically enhance your child's self-esteem and sense of accomplishment.

 

  The benefits of adding Jiu-Jitsu to your child's life goes beyond self defense. Some parents, especially in America, seem surprised that there is no sports type ""season"" to Jiu-Jitsu. It's all year availability seems, at first glance, to go against their intent to provide their child with ""well-rounded"" and diverse activities. They also fear that too many activities will take away from homework and school. In researching this view we came upon several important things any child can experience in life is what is called ""Success Spirals"". This occurs when any person, especially developing minds in children, experience an activity in which real success can be frequently achieved. Success tends to build upon success. In many sports, it can be difficult for this to happen. Not every kid can hit the game winning home run. Score the game winning goal. Not every kid can even play more than a mandated time on a basketball team, let alone sink the game winning shot. They may be on a winning team but they know someone else, not them, actually won the game. This is why some school tend to give awards to everyone on the team just for showing up. Jiu-Jitsu instead offers real, tangible, and personal success as techniques are learned and executed. The opponent taps. The bully knows to leave them alone. At the same time they learn to care for the opponent, their fellow student, in the academy. This happens every day in every class. Success spirals condition the child's mind to how success for them is possible, if not inevitable. Work pays off. Make's them better. As they experience daily to weekly success it spreads to their attitude and self confidence in all other activities they do. Along with the constant improvement in physical conditioning, itself known to improve the child's sense of well being, there is nothing that compares to Jiu-Jitsu as a way for parents to insure that their child becomes physically and mentally strong, and conditioned to succeed. The perceived less time turns into a benefit as there is less time, simply stated, for Facebook and video games, as opposed to homework.

We started as ""Skidrow Dojo"" in the back of a photo studio on Sixth Street in San Francisco February 1986. 

A group of artists & Punks asked James Friedman AKA; ""Jim Bone"" to teach them self-defense shortly after the violent murder of a loved one. Classes began in the shadow of tragedy, and Aikido in a small way helped heal the suffering these people were going through. Beginning as a club for that group of around ten friends, the dojo soon outgrew the Sixth Street studio and relocated to 759 Harrison Street in San francisco, California where it remained for three years. In 1989 we moved to 57B Stillman Street were we remained until 1999. In 1999 we moved to 141 11th Street.

Since 1986 the Dojo has hosted many of the world's highest ranking Aikido instructors, including Kato Sensei, Nishio Sensei, Anno Sensei, C. Tissier Sensei, P. Hendricks Sensei, Sugawara Sensei, Terry Dobson Sensei, K. Cottier Sensei. After the 1989, San Franicisco earthquake, James moved the dojo a few blocks away to 57 Stillman Street, and it stayed at that location for ten years. 

In 1996 Kato Hiroshi Sensei was welcomed to San Francisco, and shortly thereafter ""Skidrow Dojo"" was renamed Suginami Akikai SF.

Our present and final location at 141 11th street, between Mission and Howard streets, San Francisco, California.

KIDS SUMMER CAMP: An immersive experience in aikido, art and Japanese culture at our dojo, taught by black belts, artists, musicians and professional educators. For more information, please visit CAMP JAPAN.

KIDS CLASSES: Offering kids ages 7 and up the opportunity to train the body, mind and spirit in aikido:
Why Aikido?

Aikido is a Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba in the 1920s. Disillusioned with destructive nature of violence and war, he invented a practice emphasizing harmony over aggression as a solution to conflict. In his book about aikido, The Art of Peace, he wrote: ""In our techniques we enter completely into, blend totally with, and control firmly an attack. The way of the warrior is based on humanity, love and sincerity."" 

Aikido teaches inner calm, focus and awareness through physical and mental training. Students learn how to play, rough-house, throw, fall, stand their ground, move, and meet high-energy situations in a way that fosters empowerment and respect for themselves and others. 

Aikido is a practical martial art applicable to real-life situations. Students develop healthy body mechanics, become more physically fit, and practice techniques that are effective in a fight. They learn how to precisely deliver the powerful strikes of an attacker and how to effectively respond with aikido throws, joint locks and pins. They also learn how to roll, flip and fall out of techniques in ways that protect the body from harm. 

Aikido is empowering. Students advance internally and externally, over time learning what it means to be a responsible member of a community in which formality, discipline, challenge, aggression, sharing and experimentation are all being mindfully explored. 
What Happens in a Typical Kid's Aikido Class?

Arrival: Fifteen minutes before class, students arrive, change into their uniforms, bow and walk onto the mat. This is an important time for informal play, socializing and individual preparation for tests. 

Warm-Up: Students bow in with the instructors, transitioning to more formal training. The instructor guides students in a brief focusing meditation, followed by running, striking drills, group stretches, breathing exercises, rolling and falling practice and basic stance maneuvers. 

Training (Keiko): Students observe aikido techniques demonstrated by the instructor, pair off and practice with one another. One plays the role of attacker (uke) and the other (nage) responds with an aikido technique. Then, they switch. 

Tests and Games: These do not occur in every class, but are part of overall training. For tests, students demonstrate techniques and are awarded colored belts. Attendance, mat etiquette, behavior and skill all factor in putting up students for promotion. Students may also play one of several games designed to develop aikido-related skills while having fun. 

Closure: Students bow. Review, discussion and announcements may also be shared. At 5:15 pm, students change and are picked up by their parents. During test preparation periods, students may be invited to stay for an additional half hour of practice and instruction.

"Fight and Fitness";"http://www.fightandfitness.com/";" +1 415-255-9443";"123 S Van Ness Ave";"San Francisco";"CA";94103;;"United States";"Bunkerd Faphimai grew up in Chaiyaphum, a small country town in Thailand. His family made a living as rice farmers. When Bunkerd was just 11 years old, he was forced to quit school and get a job. At the same time, he started competing in small Muay Thai fights around the country for extra money. His first fight brought in the equivalent of one American dollar. Bunkerd dreamed of becoming a greatMuay Thai fighter, which would bring his family money and fame. Because he was shorter than the average fighter of his weight class, not too many people believed this dream was possible.

At 18, Bunkerd made off to Bangkok to try his luck in joining aMuay Thai training camp. Phillip Wong, of Fairtex, Thailand was the one who gave him his first break. Bunkerd proved all his doubters wrong and became a great champion – winning two of the most prestigious championships—one at the famed Lumpinee stadium and another at Rajadmnerm Stadium. His dedication, strength, perseverance and success in the sport of Muay Thai brought him much recognition and fame. Eventually, in the year 1992, Bunkerd came to the United States to become one of the head trainers in the new Fairtex camp in Chandler, Arizona. Simultaneously, he became a well-known world champion in the U.S. Because of Bunkerd’s humble disposition and fierce fighting style, he became known as the “People’s Champion.” It was at this new U.S. facility that Chris Cariaso and Bunkerd first met.

Chris, only 12 years old at this time, received a flyer about the Arizona gym while eating in a Thai restaurant with his mother. They immediately drove to the new facility and Chris became the very first student to sign up. Chris began training exclusively with Bunkerd. As a result, Chris excelled in this sport and began fighting at a very young age. Bunkerd and Chris became very close like father and son—Chris even lived at the gym for a period of time. Five years later, to the dismay of Chris and many other students, the gym closed down and the pair separated. At this time Bunkerd was moved around to many other gyms and Chris began pursuing another sport-BMX racing.

A few years later, a twist of fate landed the two in San Francisco at the same time. Alex Gong had started a new Fairtex in San Francisco and Bunkerd again served as head trainer. Chris, after winning the World Cup in BMX racing, moved to the Bay Area with his brother. Chris showed up at the gym with a seriously broken arm and jaw that would force his BMX career to come to a screeching halt. Chris remembered the one sport that made him strong before and decided that training with Bunkerd again was the best way to rehabilitate.

At the young age of 17, Chris became program director at the San Francisco Fairtex. Chris was a natural in this business and his enthusiasm about Muay Thai helped Alex’s business grow. Chris also began teaching classes and developed a following of dedicated private students.

After the tragic death of Alex Gong in 2003, Bunkerd and Chris decided to strike out on their own. Bunkerd, now with three sons and a wife in America, wanted to fulfill a life-long dream of owning a gym. He and Chris aggressively pursued the business knowledge needed to make this dream a reality. Once again Bunkerd faced opposition with the cynical, and this time he was not alone. Many thought Chris was too young to lead this business venture, and Bunkerd could not be his own boss. The skeptics didn’t sway the pair and finally, the hard work paid off. One of Chris’ private students rented them a space at 734 Bryant St. in San Francisco. Fight and Fitness opened its doors on March 15, 2004 and began a thriving and beloved gym.

In the age of the big corporate gym, many aspects about Fight and Fitness set it apart from the others. Fight and Fitness is family-owned and operated, and the positive atmosphere reflects that feeling. Every student is important to Bunkerd and Chris. Fight and Fitness gives every student the personal attention they deserve. The training is excellent for all ages and levels, and everyone is continually encouraged to do their personal best. Because of the opposition the two overcame, Bunkerd and Chris believe that anyone can achieve whatever they believe in. As long as you believe in yourself, they will help you achieve your goals. Their enthusiasm reflects this belief.

The pair plan to expand the business, but never at the expense of losing the personal touch Fight and Fitness acquired.";"http://www.fightandfitness.com/fnf/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-cropped-RISEBANNERNAMECHANGE-3-e1506465561145.jpg";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay Thai, Boxing, MMA";"Gym Membership

The word “maru” means circle or round.  Ray Feliciano is the owner and dojo-cho of Maru Dojo.  He currently ranks a 5th Degree Black Belt in Aikido.  The philosophy behind Maru Dojo is basic: express the technique with your body size and your body’s limitation. 
In 2013, Ray reached a fork in the road in his training: continue training in a traditional fashion or explore the ever-changing martial arts landscape.  He chose the latter.  He opened Maru Dojo, which offers classes in Aikido, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and Filipino Martial Arts (FMA).  In 2017, Maru Dojo became a member of Roy Dean Affiliate.  Ray’s interpretation of aikido is fluid and one could find traces of  BJJ and FMA in it and vice versa.  
The students at Maru Dojo are comprised of working professionals and individuals who have had injuries prior to training, but he encourages and welcomes them to pursue an active lifestyle by training within their own limitation(s); this requires putting time on the mat.  
Stepping on the mat could be intimidating but one would find the dojo atmosphere disarming.   The dojo does not promote competition in BJJ; however, during training, we pressure test the techniques by “rolling.”  It is not about tapping someone out but it is about helping each other to reach the next training plateau.  It is not about going through the motions but it is about expressing your technique; expressing your style. 
At the end of training,  your concerns, your worries, your anxiety, your frustrations, your anger, your negativity, your ego - leave it on the mat.  Together, we clean and wipe the mat and re-set for another day.  It is a rewarding “journey.” ";"N/A";"https://marudojo.com/lil-dragons-corner/";"

Every class at our academy will teach your child valuable new skills that can be applied on and off the mat. Not only that, they are going to have a lot of fun, too!

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu does not rely on brute strength or size in order to be effective. This makes it a great choice for kids. Parents can be assured that their kids will be effectively armed against bullying. Recent statistics show that at least 1 of 4 kids is bullied at school, with rates climbing to 9 out of 10 in some areas. It is also reported that 160,000 students avoid going to school on any given day in order to escape bullying. Up to 80% of confrontations with bullies turn physical. BJJ can help keep your kids safe and teach them how to successfully diffuse a situation until help comes along, all without having to resort to seriously injuring anyone.

What many parents love most about our kids’ Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu classes is the miraculous change they see in their kids’ attitudes. Principals are a big part of our kids’ program, where the students will learn not only to be more confident but also gain valuable character skills such as respect, discipline, loyalty, and teamwork. They learn how to work towards goals and develop a passion for something positive.

Healthy living is central to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu philosophy. Enrolling them in a BJJ class is an incredible gift which can give them a great start to life and teach them the importance of staying in shape, as well as eating properly. A healthy body and a healthy mind go hand in hand. Those who become lifelong practitioners will realize many health benefits and avoid many medical conditions others suffer.

Studies show that kids who train in martial arts are less likely to give into peer pressure, which can save much heartache as they grow. Additionally, Parenting Magazine has reported, “Martial arts actually helps teach self-discipline and socialization skills. In fact, many parents whose children have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report great success with these programs because self-control and concentration are exactly the skills underdeveloped in ADHD kids.”

Chief instructor Romulo Melo began training at a very early age himself and he would love to speak with you in person about the transformation he has seen in his own life, as well as what he has witnessed through training many other kids over the years.

Muay Thai, but more specifically Muay Boran and Lerdrit, run in his family for generations. His father was also a trainer and a referee in Lumpini and his uncle the same. His first lesson in Muay Boran was given to him when he was four years old. He was not a Muay Thai Champion.

He immigrated to the United States at age seven. At the age of 18 Kru Sam then trained under Master Toddy, whose father knew his father, to become a Muay Thai trainer and teacher. Master Toddy taught Kru Sam an unbeatable system of teaching and continued to train him in this manner for 10 years. He also certified him as “Kru.” Because knowing how to fight does not always translate to knowing how to train others, Kru Sam’s innate ability to teach, his Muay Boran and Lerdrit background and certification from Master Toddy are keys to his success.

Kru Sam brought Muay Thai to the Bay Area in 1991. He introduced the sport by fighting black belts in the Bay Area wherever he could. Word quickly spread and interest in the sport was immediately picked up by legends such as Sifu Harlan Lee, Sifu Shane Lacey and the Lozada family. SFPD Officer Paul Lozada gave Kru Sam his first teaching job at a small academy in downtown San Francisco. Kru Sam taught part time for years raising fighters, including Wrath James White, Alex Gong (RIP) and Richard Tan. They obtained most of their experience in gymnasiums.

When Kru Sam opened up Team USA nearly 20 years ago, he raised his second generation of Champions – David Lau, Anthony Badua and John Ellcessor. These Champions were privileged to experience Muay Thai competitions in productions brought by BJohn Promotions, Scott Coker’s Strikeforce and Dennis Warner’s World Championship Muay Thai. In fact Kru Sam, along with Coach Cung Le and Professor Navarros, brought the first “smoker” to the Bay Area in 1995. Today, Kru Sam is on his fourth generation of Champions and the team continues to grow. With the legalization of MMA, Team USA expects to add its ground game and introduce a team of MMA fighters.

For over 2 decades we’ve offered elite Muay Thai training in the San Francisco Bay Area.

We teach Muay Thai and kickboxing through a highly organized curriculum that meets varying needs. We also offer the very best Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA training for all levels. There are classes available for men, women and children of all ages and sizes. These training (Muay Thai, BJJ, and MMA), to fitness programs and even to Muay Thai for kids and families.

Atos Jiu-Jitsu, founded in 2008 by Prof. Andre Galvao and his friend Prof. Ramon Lemos, has become one the most recognized and respected names in the Jiu-jitsu industry. As one of the smallest teams in the sport, Atos has influenced the way the world practices and defines modern jiu-jitsu. Atos Jiu-Jitsu is linked to the evolution of the 50/50 guard, leg drag, and berimbolo. The original Atos team included names of Black Belt World Champions such as, Prof. Andre Galvao and Prof. Ramon Lemos, Rafa and Gui Mendes, Bruno Frazatto, Guto Campos, Claudio Calasans, Gilbert Burns, Rodrigo Caporal, Ary Frias, and Davi Ramos. Through their success, the Atos Jiu-Jitsu team has attracted talent from all over the world, and has grown rapidly becoming one of the strongest teams in Jiu-Jitsu. While the team’s origins are based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the team’s headquarters has been based in San Diego, CA since 2010. Since then, the team has added many great names to its competition team roster, including, Michael Liera Jr., Michael Carbullido, Keenan Cornelius, Jt Torres, and many more.

There is a great sense of quality over quantity within the Atos team, which relates to our motto, “Together we are Stronger.” The Atos team is currently breeding a new crop of talented Jiu-Jitsu athletes who are successfully showcasing their skills in not only in the world of sport Jiu-Jitsu, but also within the world of mixed martial arts. Many BJJ and MMA competitors seek Atos Jiu-Jitsu as thier brand of BJJ because of the success the team has experienced at the highest levels of BJJ competition. Those such as Anderson Silva, Carlos Diego, as well as Atos veterans such as Ary Frias, Davi Ramos , Bruno Frazatto and, Gilbert Burns Durinho have demonstrated great success in the most respected international Jiu-Jitsu competitions and are translating this well into the world of MMA.

Atos was founded by two friends who shared the same religious beliefs and an intense passion for Jiu-Jitsu. The word “Atos” is the Portuguese word for “acts,”, which specifically references “The Book of Acts” in the bible, based on the belief that “God can do amazing things through ordinary people, when He empowers them through His Spirit.” Today, the Atos jiu-jitsu association members and competitors continue to spread thier innovative style of jiu-jitsu across the world. You can currently find Atos affiliates in over 14 countries around the world.";"https://atosjiujitsuhq.com/wp-content/themes/atos/images/logo.png";"https://atosjiujitsuhq.com/programsclasses/programsclasses-overview/";"We believe that the practice of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is seen as a means to individual development and personal growth.

Barum Jiu Jitsu San Diego also has very flexible admission rules and class schedules. We understand that it is difficult to sometimes keep a set schedule when training. At Barum Jiu Jitsu we offer very flexible class start times and offer open mat training after every class so you can attend later to fit your schedule. Early morning and afternoon classes are available to get even more students on the mat.

We are also very proud to offer young children’s and teen classes for the young Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioner. Sport Jiu Jitsu can be acquired at a very young age (preferably 3-4 years old) and is enjoyed greatly by our youngest stars. Teen classes teach teamwork and provide an excellent after school exercise. Our instruction is a thoughtful positive resource that is social and healthy.

Our most valued accomplishment is our performance as a competitive team in our very first year. Our students are not pressured to compete, but encouraged. Many lessons are learned in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu competition and we want the student to learn them on his/her own terms.

"Clark Gracie Jiu Jitsu Academy";"http://clarkgracie.com/";" +1 619-220-4810";"1162 Morena Blvd";"San Diego";"CA";92110;;"United States";"The Clark Gracie Jiu Jitsu Academy offers the best training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu from beginners, to pro Mixed Martial Artists, and Law Enforcement.   At our Academies, we focus on the team; Meaning you, the student. Not everyone has the same reasons for training in the Martial Arts. Some enjoy the exercise, others want to learn self-defense, and some may wish to pursue a career in MMA or competition. The philosophy of this Team is to teach functional Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu that you will keep with you for the rest of your life. You will not get watered down technique, or be taught how to win a tournament without knowing how to defend yourself on the street.  We will teach you to be comfortable anywhere, with or without strikes; on the feet, on the ground, off your back, how to control the situation, and how to have fun while learning it! Many of our students are Law Enforcement, Mixed Martial Artists and members of the Armed Forces.  People have diverse needs; that is why we have assembled equally diverse resources for the students at our school.

We are led by Black Belt Professor, Clark Gracie, who is the grandson of Carlos Gracie, the founder of this Martial Art.  Clark is the only Gracie family member living in San Diego who is teaching and still competing regularly, and winning!

Carlos Gracie is the older brother and teacher of Helio Gracie. Between the two of them, they developed the most efficient fighting system ever created, Brazilian (Gracie) Jiu Jitsu.  They were able to defeat all different challengers, big and small of all other martial arts. Clark’s father, Carley Gracie, is known as the “Lion of the Gracie family” and earned his black belt from his father, Carlos Gracie.  Carley Gracie is the last of the Gracie fighters to be personally trained and coached by Carlos Gracie.  Carley Gracie is now an 9th Degree Red Belt.

Carlos taught the art of style, skill, thought and technique. His style and success was not developed through brute strength and aggressive power but rather, formulated from an almost scientific process of maneuvering, patience, flexibility, diet, strength of mind, strength of will, and self control.
Clark earned his black belt under his father. Like his father, Clark practices and teaches techniques that rely on position and leverage.  At our academy, we teach that small details are very important to get the full advantage of the technique.

Our instructors are hands-on teachers, often rolling with students of various ranks and skill levels. We teach philosophy, focusing on clearly explaining the principles of the techniques of Gracie Jiu Jitsu, in a way that people can understand.  We then incorporate drills that help students internalize those techniques in order to use them in live situations.";"http://clarkgracie.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/clarkgracie_logoTransRetina.png";"http://clarkgracie.com/about/";"Lil Lions – Ages 4-6.

The word synergy which means the combined effort being greater than the parts may describe the relationship between our Professors and students. Therefore, the essence of the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is what they are truly concern in pass it over to the students. At The Gracie San Diego Academy Regis and Professors educate the students on this secular art, and they have different approaches to do so. 
Our Goal

The Gracie Jiu-Jitsu art empowers any student with the necessary tools to achieve their highest level. Our head instructor, Regis Lebre, has the ability of showing the ways to a healthier life and the most efficient path to reach the physical, mental and spiritual strength according to each student’s needs. One of the results of this new lifestyle would be the ability of the student in understanding its own body. Therefore, the student will be more aware of its well-being and its own body needs.  Furthermore, the Nutrition, the breathing, the peace of mind and spiritual health its some of the various parts that is incorporated on the new students’ life. In addition, Gracie San Diego will be the headquarters for the competition team with the affiliated Academies around the world due to its proximity to the most important Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Tournaments. Consequently, The Gracie San Diego Academy will combine the Jiu-Jitsu program for competition since this program is inspired on techniques from Master Royler Gracie, one of the greatest competitors of all times, and the non-competition Jiu-Jitsu program. Therfore, Both of the programs will have the best support for our students. Moreover, we are the first Gracie San Diego Academy affiliated with Master Royler Gracie, and we would like you to be part of this Community.

If your child really wants to try out martial arts and you are afraid that they may punch or kick someone at school or home then this is the perfect place for you! Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a self-defense system that enables the people who practice it to defend themselves by using leverage to submit opponents. This is done without throwing punches or kicks. Using our proven techniques your child will be able to defend themselves from bullies even though we do not teach them how to strike. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a fantastic way to promote an active and healthy lifestyle for kids of any ages. Parents of our students often find that their children gain self-esteem through athletic achievement and learn how to carry themselves better in situations that require them to deal with pressure. If your son or daughter is acting overly aggressive in school, lacks focus and or discipline then we at Gracie San Diego recommend you start them out with a private lesson to introduce them to the sport and class structure. They will learn that Commitment, Respect, Focus, Self-Discipline and effort always make a rewarding experience and bring positive results.

Besides self defense skills that will give children a high degree of self confidence.  Our Kids and Juniors programs will also work on:

    Developing listening, obedience and focusing skills;
    Improving social skills;
    Improving self-control, respect and discipline;
    Increasing physical attributes such as hand-eye coordination, strength, agility and flexibility.

What makes Gracie Jiu-Jitsu so effective for kids is the fact that instead of learning moves through katas or prearranged set of movements carried out on a cooperative training partner, they will learn how to apply grappling techniques on a resisting training partner who’s not cooperating and is counteracting with his own moves, much like as what you’d see on the streets.

Are you doing everything you can to:

    Arm your child to succeed in life?
    Help them be the best they can be in school?
    Develop their self confidence?
    Assist them in developing their unique potential?
    Learn self-discipline?

Most parents do everything they can to teach these things to their children, but after school many parents need some help. The 2-4 hours that kids spend after school before their parents get home are some of the most important hours in a child's life.

How is your child spending their time After School? Let’s look at this example: The average child spends 3-4 hours somewhere after school before their parents come home. A child in 1st to 7th grade spends about 200 days in school out of the year; this doesn’t even include the 8 hours a day for 2-3 months during the summer. 200 days times 3 hours is 600 hours a year a child spends doing what?

Some go to babysitters.

Some go home and play with their friends doing whatever they want.

Others get into serious trouble.

Not Our Students.

Between the 1st and 7th grade a child spends an average of 4200 hours doing basically nothing productive. This time is more valuable than you know. In 4200 hours you could graduate from college, get your Masters Degree and your Ph.D. So why wouldn’t you let your child spend this valuable time learning skills that will last a lifetime?

When our kids get out of school, their parents know that their child is being trained in real Life Skills. With our busy 21st century schedules, it's hard to find the time and resources to really help them with these important life skills. You would think and expect that they would learn about perseverance, positive mental attitudes, self-discipline and goal setting in school, but they really don't. Students who attend Rebellion Mixed Martial Arts' San Diego Academy have an advantage over others because we teach them about these important life skills and how to develop them to their fullest! They learn success traits that will pay off for the rest of their lives.

If you have a 5 to 13-year-old looking for something to do after school, look no further. Rebellion Muay Thai San Diego After School program will provide your child with structured study time, lessons in Martial Arts, stranger danger, anger management, conflict resolution, 911 awareness, fire safety, and much more. In one of the finest facilities in the country, your child will learn life lessons that will assure a future of success. Wouldn't it be nice to have your child enrolled in a program that is committed to keeping children away from drugs and gangs?

Inspired by the Kodokan,  the International Institute of Judo located in Japan, the University of Jiu-Jitsu (also known internationally as “The U”) was founded in 2007 in San Diego, California by Hall of Fame brothers, Saulo and Xande Ribeiro. 

The Ribeiro Brothers are the winningest siblings in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu history, are multiple time World Champions, multiple time ADCC champions, teachers, mentors and entrepreneurs.

The training philosophy and techniques taught at The U are based on the Ribeiro System which includes a code of how to live in the modern world with the unchangeable principals of the 6 Blades: Family, Respect, Honor, Loyalty, Attitude and Discipline. 

The U exemplifies the best of what Jiu-Jitsu can contribute to all future leaders and residents of the community:

Ours is a wholesome, fun and clean environment. Our Kids’ Program is designed to support parents who seek a positive and respectful atmosphere for the entire family. This program includes the teaching and learning of life skills, anti-bullying, physical fitness, and body control. We value academics and provide educational support to encourage academic excellence.    

We take pride in frequently hosting international audiences; however, The U is equally proud to have established and implemented successful training programs locally with the San Diego Police Department, U.S. Navy SEALS, U.S. Marine Corps, and local correctional institutions. We strive to impart the Jiu-Jitsu mindset and skills these warriors count on when hand to hand combat and self defense are necessary.

The U is San Diego’s Jiu-Jitsu Temple. Origin, social status and ability hold no sway here; only a desire to learn, an open heart and acceptance of the unchangeable principals of the 6 Blades are needed to enter.

Whether you are a current world champion looking to sharpen your competition skills or someone who has long desired to begin a martial arts journey, The U is here to embrace and guide you.

"CrossFit Proper";"http://www.crossfitproper.com/";" +1 951-316-3323";"430 Princeland Ct";"Corona";"CA";92879;;"United States";"CrossFit Proper was established in January 2009 from the pure love of CrossFit.

We initially heard about CrossFit by watching a video of the young BJ Penn doing a muscle-up demo with Coach Glassman. It took about another two years before we would even try it because the workouts on CrossFit.com were seemingly impossible.

In 2008 a garage gym opened up in Anaheim Hills called Canyon CrossFit. We were probably one of their first clients. Within months of training with Canyon CrossFit, Christian, who was then sixteen years old, asked to go to CrossFit Trainers Certification. As parents, we truly believe our jobs are to allow our kids to find their path and feed whatever sparks their interests and makes them happy. We contacted CrossFit HQ to find out if there was an age limit to certification. There was not. And so, Christian went to cert in San Diego, CA in which Dave Castro was the lead instructor.

During cert in the good old days, you had to do Fran and Fight Gone Bad…all in one weekend. It was Christian’s first Fran and first Fight Gone Bad…both at Rx’d weights. Needless to say, that tough weekend did not discourage him, it only fed his desire to continue his CrossFit and spread his love for fitness and training people of all ages and abilities.

He started training us – mom, dad and sis. Within a few months, Christian wanted to become an official CrossFit affiliate. As parents, we still think we are crazy for telling him this, “You can affiliate if you do all the work. Fill out the application and write the essay.” It didn’tdidn’t long. Within a week, he had filled out the application and wrote the essay. We became affiliated in January 2009. We are still wondering if he is the youngest affiliate owner in the history of CrossFit.

Then, a few more family members and some friends came to train. We put up a pull-up bar in the garage, bought a plastic sprinkler garden box to jump on, bought some rings and some cheap barbells and weights. Our first rack was fashioned from plumbing pipes so that it could double as parallettes. We followed main site WODs and did what we could.

Unfortunately, we only lasted a few months in our garage gym because the neighbors called the police on us due to the loud music and “noise” that goes on when people are busy getting better.

Throughout this time, our daughter, Charisse had been a dance major and fitness instructor at UCLA’s John Wooden Center. Of course, her classes were run with the CrossFit methodology. Carissa started and finished nursing school, earning her RN license. And, Jesse held the fort down making sure everyone accomplished their goals.

Since January of 2009, we have gone through many changes starting in our garage, graduating into a 1000 square foot warehouse, knocking down a wall to expand into another 1000 square feet, then 10,00 sq. ft, and finally in 2016 we are in an intimate, private 3300 sq. ft. facility.

We are thankful every day for the wonderful, positive members that have become our family at Proper. Our “family” continues to grow in membership and coaching staff. Christian continues to expand his knowledge of health and fitness and is an alumni of California Baptist University with a Major in Kinesiology.";"http://www.crossfitproper.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cfp-header3-new.gif";"http://www.crossfitproper.com/nosweatintro/crossfit-kids-in-corona-ca/";"CrossFit Kids in Corona, CA make fitness FUN.

From 1958 to 1966 Bob and Elise worked with then famous martial artist and author, Bruce Tegner in Hollywood, CA. 

In 1964 they formed Simmons Martial Arts offering institutional and private instruction, a tradition that carries through to this day.

In 1966, they brought it to Corona, working with the Parks and Recreation Department. This allowed them to offer high quality, low cost training to the citizens of Corona. They also opened The UC Irvine Aikido Club. Robert and Elise named the school in Corona Chisai Raion, teaching Judo and Jujutsu, Yoseikan Aikido, and a mix of Shotokan and Kenpo Karate.

1967 was the year that Chisai Raion officially joined the Aikikai under the direction of Koichi Tohei, head instructor at the Hombu Dojo in Tokyo. In 1968 Kendo and Iaido were added to the curriculum.

Chisai Raion aligned their instruction with Takemusu Aikido in 1976. This follows Morihito Saito’s instruction at the Iwama Dojo. Iwama dojo, one of the oldest Aikido Dojos, is where O’sensei resided, spending the last 27 years of his life.

In 1983 Robert Simmons began to reviewed his body of knowledge in all of these disciplines and decided to codify them into a style that would become Enmeikan or Clear Circle School. It took 10 years to distill his knowledge, and in 1993 Chisai Raion became Enmeikan.

In 2000, Robert decided to retire from active instruction with Enmeikan Aikido. The Corona dojo was released to two of his best students, Dr. Thomas Van Cise and Terry McCarthy.

A new name was required and Tom and Terry formed Fudo Shin Tai or Immovable Mind and Body Aikido starting in 2001. The curriculum was mostly Aikido and Aikido weapons practice. The caveat, was that the techniques had to be effective in the street. Sensei Elise stayed on as a consultant to the school.

2006, January 16th to be exact, we lost Sensei Robert Simmons at the age of 69. Four years later in December of 2010, we lost Sensei Thomas Van Cise.

Sensei Terry McCarthy became the head instructor at the school 2011. His extensive background in martial arts, law enforcement and military service, is shaping the school to what it is now. The last three years, Fudo Shin Tai Aikido has embraced techniques from Judo, Jujutsu, and Yoshinkan Aikido. Demonstrations have been held for the school in Escrima, Pencak Silat and Lima Lama.

Sensei Elise, our founder and curriculum consultant, still attends and instructs, both in Aikido and in a womens' self-defense class in our dojo. Both Sensei Elise and Sensei Terry have been available for private instruction.

For five decades, thousands of students, young and old, male and female, from construction workers to congressmen, this school had taught them all. So now you know a little about us; let us know a little about you.

The philosophy of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is based on the principles of leverage and proper technique over strength and size. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu promotes the concept of the smaller, weaker person being able to defend against and defeat a bigger, stronger adversary using joint manipulation and a variety of chokes. Through combat sports and competitive sport Jiu-Jitsu, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu throughout its history has proven itself time and time again to be highly regarded as one of the most effective martial arts in the world. Now, why should I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you might ask? No matter your age, gender or fitness level Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is something everybody can do. The benefits of training in this martial art goes above and beyond just improving the physical aspects of your life. BJJ truly is a vehicle for self-development, and character building. Training on a regular basis will instill many traits Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners embrace as they embark on the journey, and the lifestyle it yields. You will sees improvements in focus, energy and concentration. BJJ is a very comprehensive and conceptual martial art. It allows the mind to be present and directs your attention to problem solving and quick thinking on and off the mats. While practicing techniques and applying them in class you will be giving yourself a complete full body workout, improving your cardio, strength, flexibility, and endurance. In our gym Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is like a game of human chess, however the training in the gi transfers to a phenomenal form of control, and self-defense in the street. This has been proven time and time again for many years, by practitioners who have used Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as a form of successfully controlling the attacker, and self-defense. This includes the Armed Forces, RCMP, and many security companies, (Along with our own instructors at Pacific Top Team who have used Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in their Security work). Kelowna we offer Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu classes taught by qualified and experienced instructors.

Kids Martial Arts

The Smash Gyms Kids Martial Arts Program can and WILL help your child increase their confidence, self-esteem, discipline, while teaching them life skills that will last them a lifetime! In our program your child will be able to progress at their very own pace. We understand that everyone learns differently. Whether your child can only train once a week or everyday we have the program that will fit your needs. All Smash kids instructor have full background checks and are eager to help students learn and develop. Everyday, approximately 150,000 kids miss school due to fear or intimidation of bullies. Unfortunately, this is happening to children as young as kindergarten age. Not only can bullying lead to low confidence and self-esteem issues, but it also causes children to dislike school at one of the most impressionable times in their lives. Can you imagine how it would feel to go to work every single day and be afraid for your own safety and well being?

Many kids have that same feeling while going to school every day. How can we expect children to focus well on their academics when they are under such stress? While parents may expect the teachers to intervene, the increasing statistics in bullying over the years is a clear sign that school administration is not or cannot resolve the problem. You can absolutely do something to stop or prevent this from happening to your child. Give your child the ability to stand up for him or herself. Bullies prey on those who they perceive as weak. Training martial arts can give your child the real confidence to hold their head up high and not act like someone who is an easy target. In a vast majority of situations, that aura of confidence alone will cause bullies to stay away.
Kids Wrestling

The Tutoring Center was developed at the request of parents wanting an alternative to the typical after care environment. The objective of the Tutoring Martial Arts Program is to create a fun and safe experience every afternoon after school that encourages children to build good relationships, learn martial arts, and demonstrate responsibility by completing their homework assignments. The children are continuously supervised with adult counselors who provide activity supervision, and Blackbelt Instructors who teach the martial arts classes. All on-site activities are conducted indoors and children are divided into smaller groups at the appropriate times.

The daily routine is punctual and organized. Parents can concentrate on their job with the peace of mind that their children are having fun after school, making good use of their time, and staying healthy from the exercise. Ultimately, the children will become Blackbelt Leaders and role models. The martial arts curriculum is comprehensive. If your child is attending an after care program now, then usually enrolling in our Tutoring Center is more affordable.

Instead of paying tuition for after care, at another location, and then paying tuition again for evening martial arts classes, you can have your after school needs and martial arts lessons combined together. Then, evenings can be saved for quality family time and eliminate the stress of having to manage dinner, homework, evening activities, and bed time schedules.

You might naturally associate martial arts with hollywood stunts and kicks and punches, but the self-defense aspect of martial arts is just part of it. Children that learn martial arts develop the confidence to know that if they are ever bullied, they have the skills they need to defend themselves. However, the real skill we teach is diffusing situations with words before they ever escalate to a physical level.
We teach children to focus. In this age of distractions and sensory overload, this is a skill that will provide immediate results in their academic work. 

Martial arts help teach self-discipline and socialization skills. In fact, many parents whose children have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report great success with these programs because self-control and concentration are commonly underdeveloped skills in ADHD kids.


And did we mention ... martial arts are FUN!
Consider these benefits of martial arts when enrolling your child:
 
• Fosters self-discipline
• Boosts socialization skills
• Encourages physical activity
• Teaches kids to set and achieve goals
• Increases self-esteem
• Instills a sense of respect
• Encourages non-violent conflict resolution
• Improves listening skills
• Develops teamwork skills
• Improvement in other areas of life


What does ""improvement in other areas of life"" mean? It can mean getting better grades in school, knowing how to use anti-bullying programs to prevent violence amongst peers, or simply the appreciation that comes from learning and mastering a difficult skill through practice.

Perhaps most importantly, students learn that physical activity is a healthy way to have fun. With health problems such as diabetes and obesity affecting more and more young people, parents should take steps to help their children avoid these issues. Children's martial arts gives kids a fun way to exercise, learn essential life lessons and develop a sense of self-reliance.


Lil' Dragons
Our Lil' Dragons program has been specially designed for children ages 3 to 5.
Students will learn self-discipline in a fun, structured program that helps build self-control, balance, fitness and flexibility. They'll improve their focus, listening skills, self-esteem, gross motor skills, and more.

We recognize that 3 to 5 year olds have very different developmental needs than their older counterparts. This program bridges that developmental gap and prepares students for the next level of their training. 


Youth Martial Arts

Besides from making children fit and teaching them cool self-defense moves, it also teaches the life skills your child needs like confidence, leadership and self control.
 

Our martial arts classes foster respect in all senses of the word. Your children will learn not only to respect others, but to respect themselves as well. 
 

Finally, your child will learn to interact and work with others. Not only that, it’s incredibly good exercise, keeping your children healthy and happy!";"N/A";"N/A";"Teen Martial Arts, Kickboxing ";"N/A";"Schedule will be available after filling information here: https://ultmartialarts.com/";"Monday: 8:00 AM - 8:30 PM

Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do reforms not just the body but the spirit as well using both the feet and the hands to attack and defend.​

The skills and techniques used in Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do balance the body by improving the flexibility in all areas while using the bare hands and feet in combat. This helps in showing more power and a variety of feet techniques compared to other martial arts.

Tae Kwon Do is one of the world’s strongest martial arts when it comes to feet techniques for attack and defense but with Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do  defensive skills are used first for a formidable attack. This makes Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do trainers learn not to attack and overcome others but instead to build a noble character, thus building a martial art that is based on peace, fairness, respect and love. Children and young adults that learn Tae Kwon Do will build healthy values and leadership, including an understanding that self control which comes from practice and patience.

Practitioners will learn that all things can be united with a repetition of life skills through Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do and help educate in having a virtuous and spiritual life in martial arts. Kang Yeon Tae Kwon Do strives to improve by constantly researching new techniques for training, defense and weapon development to help evolve the future of UTO (Unified Tae Kwon Do Organization).";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/29a2f2_012d71c6c5c94fb5b141dd8085554481.png/v1/fill/w_154,h_115,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/29a2f2_012d71c6c5c94fb5b141dd8085554481.png";"http://www.utoonline.com/taekwondo-for-kids";"In our UTO schools, we have developed a kids' martial arts program teaching traditional Taekwondo and valuable lifetime skills.​

Training under a progressive instructor, our students develop conditioning, self-defense, and competitive skills in a training environment that fosters the traditional values of honor, discipline, respect, and self-confidence.

The words ""Modern Training, Traditional Values"" reflect our vision and encompass the judo principles of ""mutual welfare and benefit"" and ""maximum efficiency"". Orange County Judo Training Center believes the traditional values that judo training benefits not only the individual, but society as a whole.

Our approach to training is to continually educate ourselves about the latest developments in training and instruction, and employ those developments when they are consistent with the values that have been passed down to us from our heritage in the martial arts.

Led by world class instructor Juan Montenegro and his instructional staff, Orange County Judo Training Center offers our students the opportunity to achieve their personal goals whether they are seeking competitive or non-competitive training.

We practice a traditional form of karate that was the first introduced to Japan in 1922. Our chief instructor is Master Tsutomu Ohshima, the founder of Shotokan Karate in the United States. Karate involves hand strikes, blocks, kicks, and traditional prearranged forms called kata. After some practice, the effectiveness of hand and foot techniques are applied against opponents. Practice sessions are designed to polish the techniques in a safe manner while providing excellent physical exercise. Through the practice of traditional Japanese karate, you will learn self defense in a sincere professional atmosphere. Well over 100,000 children and adults have practiced Shotokan Karate in SKA schools throughout North America since 1955. Our facilities include many colleges, YMCA’s, and recreation centers. Garden Grove Shotokan, one of America’s leading training facilities, welcomes those serious about the study of Karate-do.



The Values of Karate
In our modern society, the values are numerous. In our everyday lives we often forget the value of exercise to both our physical and mental health. The practice of karate tones the body, develops coordination, quickens reflexes, and builds stamina. Also, the serious practice of karate develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one’s mental capabilities, and more self-confidence. In this, karate is not an end, but a means to an end. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance. Rather it encourages proficiency and the keen coordination of mind and body. Karate may be defined as a weaponless means of self-defense. It consists of dynamic offensive and defensive techniques using all parts of the body to their maximum advantage. Karate practice is divided into three categories: 

    Kihon (basic blocks, punches, kicks and stances
    Kata (pre-arranged forms simulating combat situations)
    Kumite (sparring)

In each category the beginner is given instruction at the most basic level until the techniques become spontaneous. The trained karate practitioner is able to coordinate the mind and body, thereby allowing maximum physical and mental power to be expressed in most any situation. 



Our Heritage
Although the ancient origins of karate are extremely vague, we do know that about 1400 years ago while teaching at the Shaolin Temple in China, Daruma Daishi used techniques basic to karate. Later these techniques developed into fighting forms known as Shaolin Boxing. In the 16 th Century, Shaolin Boxing found its way to Okinawa from China. It was combined with native Okinawan techniques and developed into several Okinawan styles.  In 1922, having mastered two major styles in Okinawa, Master Gichin Funakoshi, then president of The Okinawa Association of the Spirit of Martial Arts, was chosen to demonstrate Karate at the first National Athletic Exhibition in Tokyo. This led to the introduction of the ancient martial art to the rest of Japan. At the urging of friends and officials, he remained in Tokyo to teach.  In 1955, Tsutomu Ohshima, one of Master Funakoshi’s last direct pupils (1948-1953, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan), came to the United States and was the first person to teach karate in this country. That same year he organized Southern California Karate Association, which has grown over the years to become a national non-profit organization, Shotokan Karate of America Inc. (SKA). All of the instructors at Garden Grove Shotokan have personally received instruction and ranking from Tsutomu Ohshima in an effort to insure lineage.

Judo students go on to achieve greatness in every field. At Irvine Judo Club, we believe everyone will become elite at whatever they choose to do in life. The life lessons learned on the mat carry to their success off the mat.

WHY DO WE TEACH JUDO TO YOUNG PEOPLE?   
Because we want young people to be strong physically and mentally, yet be compassionate and are capable of making a contribution to the world. We place your child's development ahead of everything else.
Under the watchful guidance of sensei, your child will learn to handle challenges—both on and off the mat—leaving you amazed at their transformation. Open to 6 years and up. We will accept mature 5 years old students if another member of the family is a current member and if there is an opening available.

The youth class is focused on sound basic sports Agility. Learning the basic forward and backward throws and ashiwaza foot techniques. Osaekomi pins and escapes. We stress proper etiquette, getting along with others, good sportsmanship, respect for others, appreciation of others and humility. We want them to have fun yet work hard in attaining goals.

We took great care in choosing instructors that live and teach the One Jiu Jitsu philosophy of empowerment and personal growth. Each of our instructors hold black belts in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Our head instructor, Giva Santana is a 4th degree black belt with an exceptional record in competitive Mixed Martial Arts and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. But our students and instructors know him best for his outstanding character and generous nature.

A Tough Guy with a Soft Heart
Giva Santana grew up poor in the sprawling favelas of Sao Paulo City, Brazil. He was the youngest of four children, with two brothers and a sister. At the age of 2, Giva and his family were abandoned by their father.

Faced with the choice of feeding her family or paying rent, Giva’s mother was forced to move her family into the slums of Sao Paulo. On countless nights, Giva lay starving in bed while his mother cried herself to sleep.

The intense poverty, suffering, and violence that they endured, helped pave the path for the man that Giva would become. But at the time, Giva just knew that he needed a way out of the slums to grow as a man and to make his mark on the world. He committed to five years in the Brazilian army where he got his first taste of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu from Sargent Arlans Maia. He was hooked. To satisfy his new appetite for BJJ, he soon dedicated all of his free time and energy to his practice.

When Sargent Arlans was transferred to another state, Giva was accepted into the school of legendary Master Moises Muradi and began training under Professor Raul Viera Souza. And in 1999 he earned his black belt after winning his division in the Pan Ams, and placing 2nd to Rodrigo Minautaro in the open division.

Thanks to his BJJ record, along with his inspirational background, and magnetic personality, Giva earned a scholarship to Santana University, Brazil. The poor boy from the streets of Sao Paulo was hard on the heels of his biggest dreams, and there was no stopping him now!

Four years later, he graduated with degrees in Kinesiology and Physical Education. Furthermore, he was twice awarded as the best student on campus, and once as the best athlete on campus. But Giva didn’t rest on his accomplishments. Just one week after graduating, he won the Heavyweight Grand Prix in Korea with 3 submissions! It was an amazing start to his MMA career.

Eighteen wins and just 3 losses later, and Giva retired from MMA competition. Nicknamed “The Arm Collector” for his devastating armbar submissions, Giva now dedicates his life to sharing his love and knowledge of Jiu Jitsu.

He currently has more than 20 years of experience teaching students of every level and background from children and hobbyists to professional fighters. Giva’s vision, beliefs, discipline, and values helped mold One Jiu Jitsu & Fitness into the premiere Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gym in Orange County.

"Boran Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu";"http://boranjj.com/";" +1 714-751-7505";"1548 Adams Ave # F";"Costa Mesa";"CA";92626;;"United States";"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting with the goal of gaining a dominant position and using joint-locks and chokeholds to force an opponent to submit. The art was based on early 20th Century Kodokan Judo, which was itself then a recently-developed system (founded in 1882), based on multiple schools (or Ryu) of Japanese Jujutsu.

 

It promotes the principle that a smaller, weaker person using leverage and proper technique can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger assailant. BJJ can be trained for self-defense, sport grappling (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition. Sparring (commonly referred to as ""rolling"") and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance,
especially in competition.

 

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu emphasizes ground fighting techniques and sumission holds involving joint-locks and chokeholds also found in numerous other arts with or without ground fighting emphasis. The premise is that most of the advantage of a larger, stronger opponent comes from superior reach and more powerful strikes, both of which are somewhat negated when grappling on the ground.

 

BJJ permits a wide variety of techniques to take the fight to the ground after taking a grip. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of maneuvers (and counter-maneuvers) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of submission technique. Acheiving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of the BJJ Style, and includes effective use of the guard position to defend oneself from bottom, and passing the guard to dominate from top position with side control, mount, and back mount positions. This system of maneuvering and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic chess when utilized by two experienced practitioners. A submission hold is the equivalent of checkmate.";"http://www.boranjj.com/images/boranjj_logo.jpg";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"

At Triunfo we aim to be triumphant as an academy, a team, and individuals over all challenges we may face both in martial arts as well as life.  It is said that the way we do one thing is the way we do all things, therefore the diligence, respect, humility, and confidence we develop in training begins to show up elsewhere in our lives.  Being triumphant does not always equate to a win or an end result, but rather the attitude and spirit in which we face challenges and setbacks. Winning is not always in our control, but being triumphant is and we must take full responsibility for that.  Many new students have come to me excited to be the best Jiu Jitsu practitioner, or the best Muay Thai fighter, or the best in MMA and while we stand behind any goals our students may have, it is most important that they prioritize becoming the best version of themselves. That is true triumph, that’s what Triunfo brings out in our students and community, and this is what makes us proud. 
Triunfo Jiu-Jitsu & MMA offers a wide variety of membership options to be certain we can meet the desires and best interests of our students. From a fitness membership to elite team qualification we commit to discovering the most suitable membership option for you and your family.

We take great pride in offering an academy that is clean, maintained, and full of positive energy.

CLASS DESCRIPTION
These classes are 45 minutes in length and designed for our students ages 5-10 years of age.  Your child will learn the basic fundamentals in each art, as well as enjoy games and warm-ups that help them become more coordinated and in tune with their own body. (10 years of age + will attend the fundamentals classes.)


BUILDS SELF-CONFIDENCE

We encourage students to progress at their own pace which leads to an increase in confidence levels as children accomplish new goals.
Martial arts is proven to improve children’s pose, self-confidence, and discipline that carries into home and school life.
Children not only learn to be “street smart” and develop quicker reaction skills, but we also teach them how to react rationally in potentially serious situations and/or threats.


HEALTHY HABITS AND ACTIVE LIFESTYLE

    Unlike many popular team sports today, Jiu Jitsu challenges the entire body.
    Muay Thai develops coordination and motor skills, including balance, agility, and poise.
    Both Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai emphasize good behavior and increased attention span.


INSTILLS GOOD VALUES AND ETHICS

    Statistics reveal that martial art students exhibit a lower engagement of physical violence and confrontations.
    Students learn to develop respect and compassion as they learn to understand the nature of violence and causing an individual harm.
    By practicing respect and compassion, students learn to refrain from resorting to inflicting pain and violence to resolve a conflict or issue.


CHALLENGING, YET FUN HOBBY

    Martial arts lessons are dynamic and challenging for children that are shy, bold, athletic, energetic, and maybe even a little wild.
    Our Kid’s Program encourages every child to be a winner and develop their greatest inner warrior by helping them reach for their own potential rather than competing directly against their peers.

Discipline and respect are taught by leadership and through example. This is why TRIUNFO KIDS PROGRAM IS a positive, building environment for children.";"http://triunfomma.com/womens-self-defense/";"
Women’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Fundamentals

This class provides an opportunity for women to learn Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and self defense in a safe and accepting environment. Coaches Dane and Terri teach techniques that include the greatest scope of movements found in BJJ while focusing on mechanical advantage and positional superiority as means of overcoming opponents of greater size and strength. The motto for this course: “employ structure not strength, leverage not muscle”. Please note, there is no live training included in this class.

At the age of 16, he began teaching martial arts for YMCA America's Youth Karate as an assistant. From there he began training and teaching at the Sun School of Martial Arts in Escondido.

At this time he became a Sensei. 
Sensei Jeff Brown founded The International Institute of Martial Arts in 1992 at the age of 20, with a small class in the Sports Palace (now, a church) in Escondido. This class grew from 20 students to over 100 students in just six months. The large class size forced Sensei Brown to relocate to a space on Valley Pkwy. in Escondido.

During this time the logo was created by a photography student who captured a shot of Sensei Brown's sidekick in the air. The original logo was a green globe with the side kick silhouette in the center. In 1997, The International Institute of Martial Arts had outgrown the Valley Pkwy. space and moved to 1894 W. El Norte Pkwy., Escondido . The logo became red/black and the addition of ""tradition of champions"" transpired. IIMA added a Black Belt Club, a Tournament Team and a Parent Association.

Sensei married Michelle Mourek in 1998 and they opened the Educational Edge tutoring center next door to the karate training center. The two worked hand-in-hand. Sensei Jeff Brown was inducted into three Martial Arts Hall of Fame organizations for his outstanding teaching ability and after school program initiatives. 
He holds eight World Titles and was featured on ESPN two years in a row. IIMA continued to grow with an increasing number of classes, instructors and students. The number of students doubled in just three months. By 2002, The International Institute of Martial Arts had outgrown its facility once again. IIMA moved to 456 E. Mission Rd., its current headquarters.

This facility consists of 2 Swain matted training rooms (2500 square feet each), 1 hard wood floor room, 1 room with gymnastics flooring, and one room with cardio, free weight and circuit weight equipment. Total square footage of the headquarters is 12,000 square feet. Sensei Brown became Shihan Brown in 2011 and the first bloodline Black Belts were awarded.

IIMA is now home to hundreds of World Champion Title holders. The students train with the best team of instructors, and become the best martial arts practitioners. International Institute of Martial Arts now has locations in San Marcos, Valley Center, Rancho Bernardo and Temecula.

Classes are offered for ages 3 to adult in the arts of Wado Ryu, Tae Kwon Do, Krav Maga, JiuJitsu, American Freestyle Kickboxing, and Gojo Ryu.";"http://iimakarate.com/upload/logo5.png";"http://iimakarate.com/martial-arts-programs/view/12/Kids-Programs";"Tots Class - ages 3-5
This program is specially designed for children ages 3 to 5. It helps to improve children’s focus and listening skills, self-esteem, and gross motor skills. Students learn self-discipline in a fun, structured program that helps build self-control, balance, fitness and flexibility. We recognize that 3 to 5 year olds have very different developmental needs than their older counterparts in our Children's Classes. The TOTS program bridges that developmental gap and prepares students for the Children's Classes.


Children's Classes - ages 6-11
Children's classes are designed for ages 5-11 years old. Curriculum includes traditional karate (Tae Kwon Do/Wado Ryu), sparring (light to full contact), breaking, weapons, forms, self-defense, character development, bullying prevention strategies and more!

As a sport, we teach correct posture and movement, help develop balance, coordination, strength, endurance, and physical and mental toughness. Acquiring these skills provides a foundation that later transfers to any other sport. In addition to the physical attributes, our founder Jigaro Kano created judo to develop the moral character of a person. As a philosophy, we follow Kano’s message by teaching discipline, self-respect, and respect for others. As students attain physical and mental toughness and all the other physical attributes, they increase their confidence. In the end, this is really what judo is all about and why so many people around the world are so enamored with it. You can be four years old or eighty. It is practiced in every corner of the globe. It is a science, a sport, a philosophy, a way of life.  

At SoCal Judo we also advocate a life dedicated to physical, mental, and emotional wellness. To ensure good air quality and a clean workout environment, we use top of the line, chemical free cleaning products. We are proud to say that in 8 years of operation, we have never had an outbreak of ring worm or other fungal infections.

This class is for children ages 4 to 5. It meets twice a week and we encourage you to bring your child on a consistent basis. The objective of this class is to teach kids discipline, laterality, movement patterns, balance, basic tumbling, posture, judo grips and basic judo techniques. The class is taught using a wide variety of games. Expect your child to expend lots of energy!

Fundamentals 
All children (above 5 years) enrolling in our program MUST begin in the Fundamentals class. This class follows a curriculum developed by us and covers what we believe to be the fundamentals of judo. Once the child has graduated from this class, he/she will advance to the intermediate kids class. We cannot stress enough the importance of building a solid foundation for your child. This class is usually a smaller class, allowing the coach to give your child much more attention. This system is tried and true. We have found that children who have had perfect attendance in the Fundamentals program have a 100% likelihood of continuing to practice judo and show a much greater skill retention rate, progress at a steady and faster rate and receive greater fulfillment and satisfaction out of practices.

Intermediate I & II
If your child is in the intermediate class, he/she has graduated from the Fundamentals class. This class moves at a quicker pace.
It is mandatory that your child come to practice a minimum of 2 times per week, but it is preferable that they make all 3 sessions.
At this level, your child may be asked to compete a few times a year. Competition is an integral part of your child’s judo experience. Through competition, the student gets to test their skills and the coach gets to observe holes and weaknesses in your child’s game or character. Students will first begin competing in developmental/in-house tournaments, which serve as a stepping stone to full sanctioned events.
We stress that it is not our philosophy to pressure our kids or teach them to win at all costs. We do believe in teaching them to have a desire to win, to never give up and to apply the skills that they have been taught. Competition is a great character builder. As a child faces fears, unfamiliarities and learns to perform under pressure, he/she develops life skills that they will call upon during their childhood, adolescence and adult years.

The Elite Program
This program is reserved for the children who have proven themselves through dedication, attendance, attitude and skill level, to be ready for our most demanding practices and expectations. Generally for kids 9 years old and above, but certain exceptions can be made at the coach's discretion.
Students participating in this program have 2 hour weekly training sessions (see schedule) and in addition, monthly Saturday workouts.  They also compete in at least one out-of-state tournament a year.  Additional skills such as refereeing, mental imagery, and strength training are taught.
Additional monthly fees apply.  The elite program is optional.  If a child is selected by the coach to be a part of the program, parent ultimately decides since it is an additional expense and time commitment.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://www.socaljudo.com/schedule.html";"Monday: 4:00 PM - 7:30 PM

He gets down on the mats at their level and shows them first hand how to do the techniques. His commanding presence helps even the most ""easily distracted' child learn to pay attention, be respectful and help their teammates. 

Our Academy offers several levels of classes for kids as young as 3 years old, through teens, beginners to competition level classes (see our SCHEDULE). The current students, especially the older, more experienced students, are taught how to ""roll"" with new kids, and will quickly help them adjust to the full contact sport. In a matter of weeks your child will feel like part of a big family. Many of our students have been with us since we opened doors, and now compete at the international level for our fight team.

Classes begin with a line-up, by rank, from senior belts to newest. We bow to show our respect to our Professor and coaches, and then we warm-up together. Next, Professor demonstrates the techniques we will be learning and pairs the kids up with similar size partners to do practice drills. After water break we come back to do more practice with resistance from our partners, and finally move on to ""real sparring"" under the watchful eye of professor and his adult, high ranking coaches. The classes then have a little fun, playing dodge ball or other cardio working or agility based ""games"" and end with a final line up and hand shake to all the coaches, professor and each other.

We have a bleacher type area for parents to watch the training, with free wifi and a TV lobby area with chairs and a mat for littler siblings. But be warned, after you watch your kids train for a few weeks, you may just get the bug to train yourself! Many of our kids have parents that are now training with us.

What is Krav Maga?

Krav Maga (pronounced Krahv MahGAH) is a modern and effective self defense and fighting system. It has been designed to be practical for people of any age, size, or shape. The techniques are based on your natural instincts, and can be learned quickly and effectively, enabling you to address attacks under any scenario. You will learn how to protect yourself and your family, while increasing your awareness and instinctive reflexes.

Krav Maga (Hebrew for “contact combat”) was developed by combining the most effective techniques from various martial arts and fight training. It was developed in Israel, taught to the Israeli Army, then brought to civilians in the 1970’s.";"http://www.bonnieformia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-BF-logo-header-1.png";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"bonnie@bonnieformia.com";"https://www.facebook.com/OfficialBonnieFormia/";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"No";"Does not have BJJ"

It’s a mindset made up of courage, resilience, tenacity, self-discipline and integrity. Some might call it grit. We call it the self-confidence and assurance that comes from mastering something difficult.

IN FACT YOU CAN EXPECT MANY BENEFITS FROM YOUR CHILD'S TRAINING IN MARTIAL ARTS AT PREMIER.

    INCREASED ATTENTION SPAN AND FOCUS

Children will begin by keeping their eyes focus on the eyes of people speaking to them. They will begin paying more attention to their teachers and for longer periods of time, therefore hearing and learning more. Focus is like a muscle, the more you use it, the better and stronger it gets. With martial arts training at Premier Martial Arts, we train children's muscles and mind.

    CONFIDENCE GROWTH

A confident child is a happy child. They no longer live in anxiety or fear. Confidence is the first step to get a child to succeed in all areas of life. Once confidence is developed, the instructors at our studio can now begin getting a child to perform at a level that was once un-thought of for them.

    SELF DISCIPLINE

Getting a child to do what they are told can be challenging enough, and our program will develop respectful disciplined kids, but more important is getting a child to do what they are not told. Develop self discipline is children where they have the knowledge to know what they should do, and they do it! This trait will be invaluable as they grow into successful teens and adults.

    INCREASED FITNESS AND WEIGHT LOSS

Strength, Conditioning, Flexibility and Weight Loss are all benefits that parents can expect to receive with martial arts training at Premier Martial Arts. Every muscle group is strengthened and defined with the exercises, movements, technique, and training drills that are incorporated into our curriculum. A child’s endurance and stamina will peak as we increase their cardiovascular conditioning. All these physical benefits for their body will be felt in their daily life and activities, increasing their energy and confidence.
NO ONE SITS ON THE BENCH AT PREMIER MARTIAL ARTS

Martial Arts is not a team sport, the only person that a child is competing with is “Themselves”. Kids come to us from ages 3 and up, some are in shape, while others are overweight. Some come for confidence, fitness and others for fun. Each child is treated equally, and is trained to the best of their own ability and potential. A child is never compared to anyone else. At Premier Martial Arts our instructors are there to guide, instruct, and motivate your kid to be the best that they can be.

The road to bring Gracie Jiu-jitsu to the Fresno area has been through three continents, taken over
100 years and involved some of the most famous instructors in the history of the martial arts.

In the early 1900‘s Gastao Gracie was instrumental in helping Japanese immigrants establish a
community in Brazil. It was at this time that he met a Japanese man named Mitsuyo Maeda Koma, who
was recognized as the world champion of Jiu-jitsu. The duties of Koma‘s position were to oversee Japanese
immigration to Brazil, and Gatao helped Koma greatly. The friendship between these two men became so
strong that Koma decided to do something that was not normally done. He taught Jiu-jitsu to Gasteo‘s
oldest son, Carlos. This was about 1918.

In 1925, the family moved to Rio de Janeiro and opened the first Brazilian Jiu-jitsu academy in the
world. Determined to prove the effectiveness of already developed Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Carlos issued an open
challenge to anyone who would take him on in a no-rules-match. He went on to beat all takers. Carlos also
fought in many public events. As he got older, Carlos concentrated more in managing the academy leaving
the instruction and fighting for Helio, his 11 years younger brother. Helio adapted the style of Jiu-jitsu for
his smaller frame and emphasized the use of leverage. Helio also was victorious in numerous no rules fights
and is recognized as the first sports hero in Brazilian history.

Royce Gracie is one of Helio‘s nine children. He moved to Los Angeles at the age of 18. His career as
a fighter began in 1993 after defeating three opponents in the first Ultimate Fighting Championship. His
opponents consistently outweighed him by more than 50 pounds. He went on to win 3 UFC titles and today
is the only man in the history of no holds barred matches to successfully defeat four opponents in one night.
Royce has also been very active with and has taught the techniques of Gracie Jiu-jitsu to the CIA, FBI, DEA ,
Secret Service, Army Rangers, Army Special Forces, Navy Seals and many sheriff and police departments.

One of Royce‘s top students in Los Angeles was Tosh Cook. While Royce was training for his fights
against Sakuraba and Yoshida he worked and sparred with Tosh, who was inspired to follow his mentor‘s
footsteps in the cage. After moving back to his birthplace in Fresno, Tosh set up a school that was one of
the first in the world to be officially licensed by Royce Gracie. Thus Royce Gracie Jiu-jitsu of Fresno was born.
Principles

To understand Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, you must understand the difference between a grappling art and a striking
art. Grappling arts (such as Jiu-jitsu and Judo) use wrestling-like holds to control an opponent, while striking
arts (such as karate) use kicks and punches to incapacitate an opponent. Striking arts work best when you know
an opponent is there and can launch an attack before he is close. Grappling arts are designed for close contact,
so even if you have been attacked from behind or caught in a clinch you will have a range of responses at your
disposal.

Gracie Jiu-jitsu famously turned the martial arts world upside-down by showing that, when flat on his back with
his opponent on top of him, a skilled Jiu-jitsu practitioner was still in an extremely favorable position. Having
an instant and effective reaction to an attack makes all the difference in the outcome, and the Gracie self
defense system places much emphasis on the element of surprise.
Training

Jiu-jitsu is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting with the goal
of gaining a dominant position and using joint-locks and chokeholds to force an opponent to submit. It promotes
the principle that a smaller, weaker person using leverage and proper technique can successfully defend
themselves against a bigger, stronger assailant. BJJ can be trained for self defense, sport grappling
tournaments and mixed martial arts competition. Sparring and live drilling play a major role in training,
and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition.";"http://rgjjoffresno.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/logo.png";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Intro Package-$99";"http://rgjjoffresno.com/, Scroll down";"Monday: 5:00 PM - 8:30 PM

Your first day, you will receive a full tour of the academy so that you know where everything is, including the training area, changing rooms, waiting area, and more. You will sit down with one of our Morumbi Kids Martial Arts Program Directors to have a consultation conference in order to review the goals you have for your child. After your personal consultation conference, your child will experience a one-on-one introductory class to prepare for their very first group martial arts class. In this private class, your child will learn how to fall and get up safely, the basics of discipline and focus, and also how to show self-control. Immediately after their private introductory class, your child will join a group class based on their age and ability. After you have experienced the program and have decided on the right class schedule for your child, the Program Director will go over the program options for you to decide the best choice for you and your family.

So we've put together this 3-hour 'Self-Defense for Busy Women' course held in Richmond BC in the Vancouver area to give you personal safety and awareness skills, as well as basic self-defense tools and concepts that you can learn and master quickly (and may even save your life!).

Not all courses teach the most important aspects of women's self-defense. Read 4 Common Problems with Women's Self-Defense Classes for more info. We teach using awareness & intuition, predator identification, and verbal strategies as being the first line of defense, while also teaching practical physical women's self-defense moves that use gross motor skills, making them easy to learn and use while under the adrenaline-filled, high stress context of an attack.

Self-Defense for Busy Women will teach you:

    To use awareness, listen to your intuition and identify predatory behaviour.
    How to perform verbal de-escalation
    6 practical strikes for self-defense, each of which can be learned in under 3 minutes
    Fundamentals of the ""Simple Hold Escape System""
    Self-defense from the ground
    How to react to an attack
    How items in your personal surroundings can be used as ""weapons of opportunity""

We offer our women's self-defense classes around once every 1-2 months, but may offer additional classes if there is enough demand. If our schedule doesn't work for you, you can also request to have this class run for a private group (minimum 5 students). Contact us for details.

This class is led by Lori O'Connell Sensei (5th degree black belt in Can-Ryu Jiu-Jitsu) with Chris Olson Sensei (2nd degree black belt in Can-ryu Jiu-jitsu, 1st degree in Shorinj Kan Jiu-jitsu.), assisting in the instruction. Women's self-defense students should wear clothes they feel comfortable moving in. Please arrive 10 minutes early to fill out a liability waiver.

Participation is limited to 16 women, ages 13 and up. Pre-registration for our women's self-defense class is required. Please note that girls under 19 will need to have a parent or guardian come in to sign a waiver. Sign up and pay online. If you wish to pay in person, contact us to arrange drop-off of your cash or cheque payment.

If you're looking for ongoing development in self-defense and fitness, check out our Adult Jiu-jitsu classes, which build on the practical physical skills taught in this class.

"Simi Valley Krav Maga";"http://www.simivalleykravmaga.com/";" +1 805-813-7856";"1407 E Los Angeles Ave";"Simi Valley";"CA";93065;;"United States";"Israeli Krav Maga originated as a basic hand-to-hand combat and physical fitness system that was designed to be taught quickly and retained with minimum follow up training. It evolved out of the techniques that were already being taught to the Hagganah and Palmach (Jewish guerilla forces fighting in what would become Israel) by Imi Lichtenfeld before the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) was even founded. It focused on a small number of techniques that were aggressive, simple, 

and appropriate for the basic soldiers needs, including the targeting of vulnerable body parts and plenty of rifle based combatives. It’s focus on intensity and aggression not only helped toughen the raw recruits, but it also served to condition their bodies, making them physically and mentally tougher and preparing them to face a numerically superior enemy that already had them surrounded. Because time and resources were scarce, the original iteration of Krav Maga was necessarily brief, consisting of a two week course that was added into basic recruits training and overseen by Imi himself along with several of his hand picked instructors as well as a junior Instructor cadre that received their training certification through Imi at the prestigious Wingate Academy in Netanya, Israel. The vast majority of these junior Instructors were chosen because of their athletic prowess or prior achievements in combat sports such as Judo, Karate or Wrestling. These instructors were not operational in the sense of combat operations; they were a dedicated instructor cadre whose only job was to train recruits.

When Imi retired from the military he wanted to expand Krav Maga into a full martial art and educational system for civilians. He chose his top student Eli Avikzar to replace him as the top KM instructor in the IDF, and in the early 1960’s, Imi opened his first school in Netanya, Israel to train civilians in his newly expanded Krav Maga curriculum. While Krav Maga grew out of the military and is still highly influenced by these roots, it truly blossomed as a civilian system. Several of Imi’s first Black Belts, such as Eli Avikzar and Ralphy Algrissi also held black belts in Judo and Aikido, and these arts continued to influence the development of Krav Maga throughout the 1960s. Krav Maga in civilian life was never “watered down”. In fact, its civilian evolution is quite the opposite of “watered down”, as it allows the students to learn more techniques and principles in order to cover a wider variety of threats. Krav Maga, since it’s inception has been intended to serve as a blueprint, constantly evolving to better deal with constantly evolving threats. What was never intended to change, were the principles of Krav Maga.

These principals are based on several simple concepts, including simultaneous defense and attack, controlling the enemy and the enemy’s weapons, the utilization of constant, linear attack angles, and training from a position of disadvantage. If you are watching a Krav Maga demonstration and it looks like a dance, or contains several overcomplicated movements that require exceptional athleticism, walk away, because that’s not real Krav Maga. Over the last several years, there’s been a flood of Krav Maga Instructors that use the name Krav Maga, but do not teach the system according the basic tenets set forth by Imi.";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6f9095_35ba4a7c3a2f4fd19437fdc312e798e3.jpg/v1/fill/w_561,h_251,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/6f9095_35ba4a7c3a2f4fd19437fdc312e798e3.jpg";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"https://www.simivalleykravmaga.com/schedule";"N/A";"Darren Levine";"N/A";"SImivalleykravmaga@hotmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/Simi-Valley-Krav-Maga-44991404395/";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"No";

At that time, we only taught Senkotiros Arnis (Philippine stick and knife fighting) and Kajukenbo, which is a hybrid street fighting art comprised of Karate, Judo and Ju-Jitsu, Kenpo Karate and Chinese and Western Boxing.

In 2005, Master Tim changed the name of the school to Delta One Martial Arts and Fitness Center and he incorporated Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Kickboxing into our curriculum.

In 2014, Master Tim saw the necessity for yet another change, modernizing our system to fit the self-defense needs of today’s society and creating an exciting program designed to help people mature, develop and grow to reach their full potential.

To complete our well-rounded martial arts program, known as the Kajukenbo “Urban Self-Defense” System, we included Krav Maga, a highly effective self-defense system created and taught by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) into our curriculum. We saw that by blending key concepts and techniques from the different martial arts programs we taught into one system, it made that system highly effective and extremely practical for today’s urban environment. Our students are now capable of defending themselves standing, on the ground, against multiple attackers and attackers with various weapons, such as knives and guns. They are also capable of utilizing sticks and knives as a practical and realistic means of defending themselves.";"https://s3.amazonaws.com/zenplannerwordpress-stack0/wp-content/uploads/sites/147/2017/02/21145403/D1-and-Only-Martial-Arts.png";"https://d1andonly.net/programs/#childrens_program";"Our children’s program focuses on teaching our students respect, discipline, focus and self-control, as well as practical and realistic self-defense for today’s urban setting.

*Get the most out of your training. Even if you are attending classes, private sessions will help you get a better understanding and grasp of the foundation of the art.

“MA FIT LA is the future of Martial Arts and Fitness” says Todd Shawn Tei. Tei is a Wing Chun Kung Fu master and fight choreographer. He’s also the founder and Chief instructor of MA FIT LA.

Tei’s school has long been Los Angeles’ go-to spot for authentic Wing Chun Kung Fu training. Its students range from preschoolers to working professionals; many parents contact the school initially for their children, and then can’t resist joining up themselves after observing a few classes.

After teaching Wing Chun for many years I wanted to expand my school by offering Fitness and Martial Arts classes for group and Private training. I also wanted to add other styles into the mix, so we’d have something for everyone. We not only teach Wing Chun but Muay Thai, Karate, MMA and have an incredible Cardio Kickboxing/Crossfit workout program. Each style we teach has a different instructor that only focuses on their style alone. We also have a great facility with equipment for weight training and we incorporate Ninja Warrior type drills into our programs, said Tei.

“In recent years, the style Tei teaches called Wing Chun has exploded in popularity due to the Ip Man movies depicting the life of Bruce Lee’s grandmaster,” said Tei, who also works as a fight choreographer and actor, most recently enlisted by DC Entertainment’s “DC All Access” webseries to star as Batman in a soon to be released fighting tutorial aimed at fans who want to learn the Caped Crusader’s signature moves. Although created by a woman, the Wing Chun style is equally popular with men — famous practitioners include Robert Downey Jr., Christian Bale, Jackie Chan, and of course, Bruce Lee.

Even the children are trained to hone their combat skills, albeit in an age-appropriate setting. “With the kids, it’s more about awareness: teaching them to identify and avoid bullies and dangerous adults. Parents choose us because our classes are fun, not overly formal or stiff.” On review sites, parents echo Tei’s sentiments, with one father raving, “3 months into MA FIT LA, he got student of the month, grades rocketed up, and now his confidence level is high without the cockiness.”

“The best thing about MA FIT LA and the styles we offer is that we cover everything you could want in martial arts: it works on the street, it’s fun to learn, it helps you balance and center yourself,” said Tei. “When our students work to master Wing Chun, they’re really working on mastering themselves.”";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c22.0.200.200/p200x200/11903909_1478083462515112_7989659138251053302_n.jpg?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeHs5D6XmoNP_XKzrhXBmgymjTyNP3XjHStKuaZPTC8PNs52YFu3Hy1Jv1GOv20mgVJGKP6ts-k1y-1NsBHr22SNudjP1vx4MmSwcJnKd65eTg&oh=92722fd70c12780489aa01d3943e3a79&oe=5B0496A0";"http://www.mafitla.com/childrens-classes/";"PANDAS (AGES 3-5)

Burbank Kids Class

What makes our Burbank children’s martial arts program different than the rest?

    Classes 7 days a week so even the busiest family can attend
    Age-appropriate lessons – older children join Tigers (ages 5-7) or Dragons (ages 8-13)
    A focus on life skills so your child can excel at school, behave at home, and play confidently and nicely with other kids
    Individual attention with multiple instructors and helpers per class. We ask each Panda for their personal best!
    Monthly events including safety seminars (bullying, kidnapping and street safety awareness), family days, and themed days such as Superhero Day and Ninja Day

Kung Fu is Super Fun!
We teach authentic Wing Chun Kung Fu, the style of Bruce Lee and Grandmaster Ip Man.
The Little Pandas also learn Shaolin Kung Fu and Tai Chi. Each class will hone your child’s focus, discipline and control while enhancing their balance, fitness, and reflexes.

Every single one of our instructors is an incredible martial artist from our own Adult/Teen program. No strangers off Craigslist. Just encouraging, friendly, passionate martial artists who love to teach kids.


Safety from Kidnappers and Strangers
    “When I ask new students what a stranger is, they usually tell me that they wear black and are very sneaky.

    When I ask them what they should do if they get lost at the store, they often describe going outside and looking for their parents’ car.

    They don’t know to dial 911 if there’s an emergency.

    They don’t know that they tell their parents right away if another adult asks them to keep a secret.

    Within a year of joining, most of my Burbank martial arts kids can answer every single question correctly without hesitation. And they can physically and vocally demonstrate how to fight off a kidnapper or dangerous adult.”

    – Todd Shawn Tei, Program Director

TIGERS (AGES 5½-7)
Why is our Tigers program so popular with parents seeking Burbank martial arts for kids ages 5-7?

The answer is simple: here at MA FIT LA in Burbank, we transform children into confident, enthusiastic leaders.
Children ages 5 to 7 are just deciding what type of students they will be. Will they excel in elementary school, willingly volunteering answers in class and playing happily during recess and parties? Or will they struggle academically and socially? Our Kids’ Kung Fu program teaches children that they can achieve anything with hard work, in and out of our martial arts program.

 

There are hundreds of martial arts schools in Los Angeles, but many parents commute across town so their children can study Wing Chun Kung Fu with us. Here’s how one Northridge parent put it:
Kids Learn Focus, Discipline and Confidence

We teach Kung Fu, the style of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and many other famous martial artists. Of all the traditional martial arts, Kung Fu offers students the best tools to improve their physical, mental, and emotional fitness. Among other benefits, our Tigers work to improve their skills in the following areas:

    FOCUS: Focusing on the teacher and the task at hand
    WORK ETHIC: Setting a goal and following through
    RESPECT: Respecting classroom rules and etiquette
    PERSEVERANCE: Tackling difficult tasks with enthusiasm and confidence
    SAFETY: More aware of safety rules and Stranger Danger
    BULLY-PROOFED: Confident around bullies, compassionate toward other children
    LEADERSHIP: Volunteering to lead and answer questions – no more wallflowers!

The Tigers program teaches children age-appropriate lessons in the most popular martial arts in Los Angeles.
Wing Chun Kung Fu is REALISTIC Self-Defense for Children

Wing Chun was the style of Bruce Lee and his teacher, Grandmaster Ip Man. Unlike most martial arts, which rely on brute strength, Wing Chun was invented by a Shaolin nun to be effective for smaller practitioners – perfect for your Kung Fu kid!

Our children learn techniques and strategies to deter both bullies at school and kidnappers on the streets, while also learning when and how much force to use in each situation. You can breathe a little easier knowing that your children will learn how to protect themselves and find help anytime they feel threatened.

More Discipline, Leadership and Fitness, Too
Shaolin martial arts and Tai Chi, such as what you’ve seen practiced by Jackie Chan and Jet Li, builds discipline, fitness, balance and strength. These life skills will improve your child’s performance in the classroom and in their other extracurricular activities.


DRAGONS (AGES 8-13)

Looking for martial arts for older children and pre-teens? Read on for more info!
Here at MA FIT LA  in Burbank, we know you want the very best for your kids. Read more to learn why parents call us the best Los Angeles martial arts school for children.
Our martial arts programs for children are completely unique, which is why many of our Kung Fu kids commute from La Crescenta, Pasadena, Beverly Hills, Northridge and West LA. We offer age-appropriate training for Little Pandas (ages 3-5), Tigers (ages 5-7), and Dragons (ages 8-13).
Why do parents skip over the martial arts schools in their own towns to bring their kids to us? As one of our students put it:
Real World Self-Defense Training

Kids Kung Fu
The Dragons program will help your child/pre-teen (ages 8-13) develop physical, mental, and emotional discipline while perfecting their martial arts technique. Your child needs these skills to navigate the academic and social pressures of junior high. They need the self-confidence to say “Yes, I can” as well as the self-respect to say “No, I won’t.”

Our Dragons learn advanced Wing Chun techniques and apply their skills in drills and sparring. Wing Chun, the style of Bruce Lee, is widely considered the best martial arts style for self-defense because it focuses on training for the real world, not tournaments. We cover the entire Wing Chun system with our Dragons. With hard work and commitment, our highest level Dragons learn aspects of the Wing Chun system even Bruce Lee didn’t know.

Dragons also study Shaolin Kung Fu and Tai Chi to hone their fitness, focus, and balance. With increased focus, your child may begin to achieve better grades at school, laying a stronger foundation for the tough academics taught in junior high and high school.

Best Burbank Martial Arts for Children

Children receive many conflicting messages about life: from us, from their friends, and especially, from the media. For generations, parents have turned to traditional martial arts in Burbank to ensure their children learn respect, discipline, and compassion for others.

Our goal every day is simple: encourage your children to do a little better than they did the day before. Could your “C” student be a “B” student with just a little more self-esteem? Could your “mostly As” student turn into a “straight A” student with just a little more motivation?

    They will develop strong leadership skills and abilities, including public speaking — no more being too shy to answer questions in the classroom!

    They will learn realistic self-defense skills, with different techniques for use in bullying and kidnapping scenarios
    They will drill how to handle school bullies without fighting, while also learning how to defend themselves if a school confrontation turns violent.

Consisting of two groups, Mini Mamutes (4-7) & Little Mamutes (8-13), we have classes every day except Sundays.

Professor Bruno’s ability to teach even out littlest rollers, is fantastic to watch. He gets down on the mats at their level and shows them firsthand how to do the techniques. His commanding presence helps even the most ""easily distracted' child learn to pay attention, be respectful and help their teammates.

Our Academy offers several levels of classes for kids as young as 4 years old, through teens, beginners to competition level classes. The current students, especially the older, more experienced students, are taught how to ""roll’ with new kids, and will quickly help them adjust to the full-contact sport. In a matter of weeks your child will feel like part of a big family. Many of our students have been with us since we opened our doors, and now compete at the international level representing the academy.

Classes begin with a line up according to rank, from senior belts to newest. We bow to show our respect to our Professor and coaches, and then we warm-up together. Next, Professor demonstrates the techniques we will be learning and pairs the kids up with similar size partners to do practice drills. After a water break we come back to do more practice drills with resistance from our partners, and finally move on to ""real sparring"" under the watchful eye of professor and his adult, high-ranking coaches. The classes finish with a final line up and handshake to Professor, coaches and each other.

We have bleacher seating for family to watch the training. But be warned, after you watch your kids train for a few weeks, you may just get the bug to train yourself! Many of our kids have parents that are now training with us. It is a great way to spend some quality and healthy time together.

Arm your child with self-defense. Our specialized programs will teach your child to be safe, follow instructions, and improve concentration in a fun, positive atmosphere.

What Your Child Will Experience
Fast-paced, fun-filled classes are approximately 30 minutes long. The key is the emphasis on advancement and growth based on each child's individual pace. Classes become more challenging as each child demonstrates the readiness to accept more complex skills. Children will begin to grasp the concept of self discipline as they achieve goals. When he/she tackles more difficult goals, the self-confidence grows and serves as a strong foundation in all aspects of life, including academics, sports, arts and socially as well.

The ATA Martial Arts Formula
The ATA Martial Arts Tiny Tigers program is the perfect choice for your preschooler. Your child will have fun while learning developmental skills, all within a safe, healthy and exciting environment. Our program works unlike any other children's activity simply because it has the perfect blend of fun and learning. After results You Can Expect:

- Increases Attention Span
- Builds Confidence
- Increases Hand-Eye Coordination
- Develops Sharing and Social Skills
- Certified Instructors

Your child's classes will be lead by a child-care professional specially trained to provide motivational instruction. Each instructor is carefully selected and undergoes extensive testing in order to receive certification credentials. Instructors are required to be re-certified yearly to assure your child the highest level of instruction.


Karate for Kids (ages 7-12)
Home of the nation's world famous Karate for Kids Program where your kids will develop greater self-esteem, discipline, and leadership skills while learning self-defense.

There are many reasons for kids to become involved in the martial arts. We have developed a program based on traditional Taekwondo for kids called Karate for Kids. The Karate Kid system is based on a lifetime learning concept in addition to technical skills.

Martial Arts is Great for Children
A psychological study found that children in martial arts have an increased sense of responsibility and a decrease in the willingness to take foolish risks. They also have a high sense of self-esteem. This is why millions of parents are using martial arts to supplement their children's education.

Parents enroll their children in our programs for different reasons, but with one common goal: to help their children grow and mature to the best of their abilities.

Parents play a unique role in their children's training, acting as the liaison from the karate school to the home. The more an instructor knows about a child's home and school life, the better he/she can work with the child and the parent.

Our Reward System Improves Children's Self Esteem Our belt and award systems are the keys to building self esteem. When kids earn their belts or earn stars for grades, it gives them a great sense of accomplishment that really improves the way they feel about themselves.

Our Program Teaches Children Discipline
We have a trained staff of patient instructors who love to work with children, but are also very clear about limits. We enforce good rules and behavior in class and we expect the same good behavior at home and in school.

Our Activities Channel Children's Aggression
Many doctors have prescribed our school because of the positive outlet it gives the kids for all their energy. In fact studies have shown that children who learn Self Defense become more assertive & less aggressive.

Self-Discipline + Self-Defense = Self Confidence
Children who know how to defend themselves usually don't have to, because they carry themselves in a more confident manner, and confidence alone is a deterrent to bullies.

Why is Martial Arts Training so Popular?
Martial arts training is so popular because no other activity can provide the same positive results, on a personal level, for each individual participant. Whether your goals are self-confidence, self-defense, personal development, fitness, flexibility or to earn a black belt, our school will take you and your children there. From our pre-school programs to our martial arts fitness programs, our instructors are dedicated to helping you and your family achieve your specific goals.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Monday: 2:00 PM - 9:30 PM

"wolfpac combat ju-jitsu";"http://www.wolfpac.co.nr/";" +1 310-938-8955";"316 W Beach Ave";"Inglewood";"CA";90302;;"United States";"Welcome to Wolfpac Military Combat Ju-Jitsu 

Since 2005, Wolfpac Combat Ju-Jitsu has been providing instruction in Military Combat Ju-Jitsu and Mixed martial arts to Military units all over the state of California. This is the Home of The WolfPac Combat Ju-Jitsu Academy and 4th Military Police CSMR Combat Martial Arts training teams. 

What is Military Combat Ju-Jitsu?

 The system of Military Combat Ju-Jitsu is a mixed hybrid form of many grappling and striking art forms. The Military Combat Ju-Jitsu system was created using only the most effective techniques found in Traditional Japanese Jujitsu, Judo, Aikido, Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu, Russian Sambo Combat Wrestling, Muay Thai,  Kenpo Karate and the U.S. Army Combatives Fighting System. 
The Military Combat Ju-Jitsu system Was created for one purpose, Survival and dominance in combat. Most traditional martial arts are used by many entities  for self-defense. Military Combat Ju-jitsu is at the opposite end of the spectrum from self-defense. Self-defense techniques are designed to repel an attack and allow escape from harm. Military Combat Jujitsu techniques are meant for closing with the opponent and to allow for complete dominance of the situation. 


A Quick Study in Combatives 

What can you do to maintain your own personal protection? Here are some general pointers when it comes to self-defense: 

1. Situational Awareness. Look for trouble before it comes to you. Watch out for those with cloaked weapons, such as knifes, and be aware of peoples body language or attitude that convey danger. 

2. Be Ready to Move Fast. A typical knife fight lasts 3 to 5 seconds. In close quarters, there may not be time and room to use a rifle or handgun. Be prepared to evade and counterattack. If you have to, improvise by using environmental items within reach to defend yourself or attack. 

3. Keep Techniques Simple. Whether on defense or offense, use simple, direct, hard and effective punches, kicks and other moves. Dont waste motion. No fancy stuff. 4. Practice in Realistic Scenarios. In training, try to create the sights, sounds and feel of real-life situations, such as a street scene. Then learn to analyze, communicate and use appropriate force to achieve a successful outcome.

There must always be, of course, the provision of true expert instructors and no one has access to more of them than the members of the Gracie Family who run all the best schools in Brazil since 1925.
At the Charles Gracie Academy, you will receive the highest level of training and personalized attention directly by a senior member of the famous Gracie family of Jiu-Jitsu teachers and fighters who did so much to change the shape the current state of martial arts instruction in America.

The Charles Gracie Academies are now located throughout all of greater Northern California and in Nevada. In the Bay Area we have San Francisco, San Mateo, and Daly City. In the Central Valley we have Tracy and Modesto. In the Truckee/Tahoe area we have our academy in Truckee; and, in Nevada we have our academy in Reno. Our students are welcome to train at any time in any of our locations.
All the way on the other side of the interest spectrum is the competitive world of BJJ tournaments as well as open grappling tournaments. Gracie academy students have excelled in every competition from local events all the way up to the Mundial or World Championship and US National and Regional BJJ and grappling tournaments.

Charles has instructed members of the law enforcement officers, security professionals, U.S. armed forces, air marshals, as well as private citizens. Students come to train and improve their skills at our academy. Jiu-Jitsu, however, is for everyone, regardless of age, gender, body type or physical ability. By using leverage, balance and technique, a weaker individual can defend themselves against stronger, more physically capable opponents.

Finally there is the ultra-competitive world of MMA or Mixed Martial Arts. Jiu-Jitsu is beyond an absolute must for any person who dreams of entering the world of MMA events. Without mastering the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, along with other Martial arts such as karate, judo, and kickboxing, they have no ability to truly and effectively compete in MMA.

We are confident that Jiu-Jitsu will become one of the most cherished and enjoyable aspects of your life regardless of physical condition, age, or past experience. It will give you a confidence, knowledge and body-dexterity and fitness that few people will ever know.

I look forward to sharing my family’s art with you!

Mental wellness is equally important, and classes are designed to boost a student’s self-confidence.

In addition to physical wellness and increasing self-confidence, enrolling your child in Charles Gracie Jiu-Jitsu offers a number of other invaluable benefits that will stick with your child for a lifetime:

    Bullyproof your child. Although schools are now implementing anti-bullying campaigns, these initiatives are not 100%. Bullies have always existed, and they will continue to do so. Bullyproofing your child with the knowledge and skills of jiu-jitsu will afford him/her with the unshakable confidence required for self-defense against harassment.
    Make better life choices. Self-defense techniques increase a child’s self-esteem, which allows him or her to better resist peer pressure by being confident enough to know how to easily cope with aggressive kids and, in the future, adults. Your child will be better equipped to make better life choices now and in the future.
    Lifelong self-discipline. The Gracie Kid’s Belt System rewards students for their hard work. As a student, your child will have the opportunity to earn a new stripe for every 20 classes s/he completes. Each promotion reinforces hard work, ethics and perseverance, and your child will experience an incredible sense of pride with each achievement.
    Physical and mental wellness. Self-defense exercises the mind and body. With childhood obesity at an all-time high, it has never been more crucial for children to stay active. Your child will have a fun learning experience while receiving a full-body workout.
    Stronger parent-child bond. The self-defense techniques promote close physical contact, encouraging a stronger bond between you and your child. You and your child can enjoy an educational, fun and physically challenging experience.

What to Expect on the First Day
Many kids and teens may feel reserved and nervous on their first day of class. Many movements, techniques and positions will be foreign to them, and some may feel unnatural. It is completely normal to feel timid in the beginning; however, the goal of the first class is to encourage the class to come together as a support system, and many students relax quickly and are excited to continue.

Warm-ups kick off each class, and we make this time fun and fast-paced. Every child is encouraged to participate, although they are welcome to sit back and observe before jumping in.

Sparring and competition are not class requirements, but most students are eager to try out new techniques. Every class session closes with fun and engaging games that reinforce what was learned.

Classes will vary upon location.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"https://www.charlesgracie.com/locations/academy-locations/daly-city-ca/";"Monday: 3:00 PM - 9:00 PM

Our BJJ, NOGI and JUDO programs are a progressive and reality-based style of self defense. This program has been specifically designed to help children learn realistic self protection techniques.
BRAZILIAN JIU-JITSU:

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting. It is a derivative of early 20th century Kodokan Judo,[ which was itself then a recently-developed system (founded in 1882), based on multiple schools (or Ryu) of Japanese jujutsu. Like judo, it promotes the principle that smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger assailant using leverage and proper technique; applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat them. BJJ can be trained for self defense, sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition.Sparring (commonly referred to as ‘rolling’) and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition
NoGi:

(also known as submission fighting, submission grappling ) is a formula of competition and a general term describing the aspect of martial arts and combat sports that focus on clinch and ground fighting with the aim of obtaining a submission using submission holds.The sport of NOGI brings together techniques from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Folk American Wrestling (Catch-as-catch-can), Luta Livre Esportiva, Freestyle Wrestling, Judo and Sambo. Submission fighting as an element of a larger sport setting is very common in mixed martial arts, Pankration, catch wrestling, shootfighting, shooto and others. Submission Wrestler’s or Grapplers usually wears shorts, skin-sticky clothing, speedos and mixed short clothes so they do not rip off in combat.
JUDO:

(柔道 ,jūdō?), meaning “gentle way”, is a modern Japanese martial art (gendai budō) and combat sport, that originated in Japan in the late nineteenth century. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the object is to either throw one’s opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue one’s opponent with a grappling manoeuvre, or force an opponent to submit by joint locking the elbow or by executing a choke. Strikes and thrusts (by hands and feet) — as well as weapons defences — are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms (kata) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice (randori). Ultimately, the philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for almost all modern Japanese martial arts that developed from “traditional” schools (koryū). In addition, the spread of Judo world wide has led to the development of a number of offshoots such as Sambo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Practitioners of judo are called jūdōka.

While Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a comprehensive martial art that addresses striking, takedowns and grappling, we focus on teaching kids to use leverage and technique to subdue their opponents without using punching or kicking.  This method allows students to maximize their strengths, even if they are faced with a bigger, stronger opponent.  Because we teach self-defense without striking, our students are able to effectively keep themselves safe, without having to resort to punching or kicking.

Ronin is a Japanese term for an outlaw or masterless Samurai. 'Ro' meaning wave and 'Nin' man, the word literally means ""man tossed around like a wave."" The Dojo was founded by men in a state of chaos. Discontent to subscribe to just one art or method of training, they learned and tested many. Drawing on Okinawan Karate, Ninjutsu, Akido, Muay Thai, Boxing, SIlat, Kali, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Catch Wrestling, Bujutsu, they engaged in no holds barred training before the UFC and the Gracies transformed mixed martial arts into a mainstream phenomenon.

For the first decade the teachers and their students were a rag-tag underground group of fighters and rule-breakers. Their reputation was for intensity, pushing limits, and a voracity to test everything. From the fires of this group the art began to take shape.
The Growing Years:

As the school grew, its distinct nature began to become apparent. This nature was about being  a training grounds for life. Here students came to learn that the limits they believed they were bound to didn't exist, and that the human capacity was far beyond anything they'd ever imagined. A return to nature, a de-evolution to states of harmony and primal strength fueled the art and those who trained in it.

Martial arts was a vehicle that encompassed warrior training on many levels. Mastery of movement became the study of working with opposing force through the fighting arts. Mastery of breath and self through Lung Gom, meditation, and tests by the elements of nature expanded students awareness and control. Wilderness survival, attunement, and tracking brought them directly in touch with nature and the place humankind holds as a part of the larger whole.
Where we're going:

It is time to share the lessons of the past and ride the wave that has been building for 20 years into the future with the Fort Collins community. The Dojo opened its doors in 2013. It is in a beautiful location, with forests, ponds and the Poudre River right outside as our training grounds. From this humble beginning it is our mission to enlighten the Fort Collins Community to the mental and physical benefits of combining martial arts, yoga, and fitness into one harmonious lifestyle.

This is a way of life, a path to getting more out of everything. The way of the warrior is not the sole domain of young men. It is about creating strength and harmony through personal cultivation. Through our synergistic programs of Martial Arts Fusion, Vana Flow Yoga, and Sarasya Tone fitness along with the other programs offered you can find yourself more balanced and centered, healthier, and capable. Come in and see what we are about for yourself.

Meet the owners and their family

Charles Orchard has been involved in Fort Collins Martial Arts for over 32 years, with most of those years as an instructor and dojo owner.  His experience is vast and far reaching.  Besides Jiujitsu, he is an expert in traditional Karate, weapons systems and modern combatives.  With continuous study of his own systems combined with research and study of other common styles of martial arts,  his knowledge of martial arts, fighting systems, and training methodologies is unmatched.   Besides his dojo teaching experience, he brings 25 years of risk assessment, health and safety and corporate training experience to the table.  During his early years in his teens and twenties he was a top competitive athlete on the state and inter-mountain regional level.   Because of his athletic career and fitness hobbies he developed a keen understanding of athletic training principles and methodology.  With this huge library of information he is able to serve, teach, guide instruct and train his students to achieve what they thought was impossible.

 

Jill Orchard, Charles’ better half has almost 25 years in the martial arts with specific training in traditional karate and jujitsu.  She is a very experienced instructor of young children.   Her experience comes from not only her dojo career but from her professional life and church service.   With Jill’s vast amount of experience with young children, there is no one more qualified and capable of teaching this awesome age group.  Jill is a dedicated wife and mother who also loves to help children, women and young girls find their power, and strength.  One of her passions is teaching young girls to be assertive and prepare for the harsh realities of the adult world. 

 

Charles and Jill are motivated to help improve the life’s of all those come to them, whether it is in the traditional classes or through their self-defense programs.  Empowering individuals to overcome violence and problems in their life’s is truly their passion.

 

Now that you have read the bio, let me elaborate on my martial arts history some.  I was very fortunate to be able to learn martial arts as a teen in the very early 1980’s.  The system that my brother helped get me involved with was very unique.  Not only did we have traditional karate, not the sport kind, but we also had traditional jiujitsu and traditional weapons systems (kenjitsu, Iajitsu, sai, tonfa, bo etc).  These were all under one roof so to speak.  This is quite unique and very rare.  One of the very interesting things about my training is that we were doing newaza, or ground fighting or brazilian jujitsu before anyone had even heard about it.  This type of fighting was common in competitive judo, but not for self defense.  We had incorporated it as part of our regular training, with the philosophy of you don’t want to fight on the ground but if you should find yourself there, do what is needed and get up. 

 

Why Karate and Jiujitsu, why not just choose one?

The kata which is the backbone of karate learning is a series of moves that means something, actually each move has many different applications.  These moves in the kata or form have striking or karate applications and they also have jiujitsu or throwing applications.  In fact when you really look close and study the movements you see, joint locks, throws, strikes, kicks, blocks, sweeps, chokes, and so much more including multiple attackers. So just learning how to kick, punch, block (what most people understand as karate) is very elementary.

 

Karate Instruction at Total Ryu

 

Karate instruction today is commonly done in a very superficial manner, you learn the basics blocks, punches, strikes and kicks.  Then you learn how to apply them in a sparing environment.  You may learn kata or forms, but you won’t learn what they mean beyond the obvious.  This is not the way it is meant to be taught.  Yes we do all the above, but while we are doing that you are learning what things really mean, and how to apply them in the traditional and very effective way.  We also teach how to understand movement and why you need it.

 

Jiujitsu instruction at Total Ryu
Jiujitsu or jujitsu is an awesome martial art.  It is so awesome that there are many many copies and modern derivatives of the art.  Jujitsu was the main hand to hand system of the Samurai.  Along with other martial systems the samurai used jujitsu to disable armed and unarmed opponents in a very powerful, fast and effective manner.  Total Ryu maintains these systems in it’s traditional jujitsu course.  Along with jujitsu we have the subset martial arts systems of akijitsu, newaza (ground or the popular brazilian jujitsu) and others. The throwing techniques closely resemble Judo.  However, judo is a sport and jujitsu is combat, so there are many different variations that we do at Total Ryu that are not allowed or even thought of in Judo.   

 

Both Jiujitsu and Karate together, is a partnership that is AWESOME

 

When you can combine both jiujitsu and karate into one system, it is absolutely amazing what can be done.  The kata come to life with real, effective and powerful applications and techniques.  The multiple attack defense is obvious.  Using motion against one individual to effect another attacker is simple.  I could go on and on. 

At Total Ryu you can learn Karate or Jujitsu or Both, you are not limited with one, till you learn the other.  The choice is yours. ";"https://www.ftcollinsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/LOGO1.png";"https://www.ftcollinsmartialarts.com/kids-martial-arts/";"Our Kids Martial Arts Classes.

Our goal and desire with all of the kids classes is to teach character, discipline, fitness and life skills while having fun and learning something useful.  We teach very real martial arts, not sport or competition style.  When you join our family, your child will be treated like our own and we will do our best to teach them the ideals of character, safety and manners, while they are learning the best martial arts around.
Having fun while learning a life skill is something that is not very common in today’s world. Total Ryu’s Traditional Martial Arts program is just that – fun and educational. Self-defense, physical fitness, jujitsu, karate and agility are taught in a fun, friendly, engaging environment.  The low student-to-teacher ratio helps with understanding the basic skills and helps progress the understanding of the principles which are presented. The most amazing part about this program is that students feel an almost immediate sense of accomplishment.  Confidence, excitement, and teamwork are abilities that will follow the students in other aspects of life. The nature of traditional martial arts training has mutual cooperation and discipline at it’s core. Students learn to get along with other students because they can’t do the leg sweeps, throws or basic techniques without a partner.

 

Each class starts with a warm up period that includes running, stretching and fall practice. We teach every student how to fall safely so that they can have more fun while training. Flexibility plays a huge part in having a healthy life through adulthood, which is why we teach this basic principle starting at a very young age. The stretches that we perform in class are very easy for most kids to do. If they keep doing these stretches throughout their life, their overall fitness and health will be enhanced.

 

The next section of the class is what we like to call Mat Chat. This is where we discuss and emphasize concepts of child safety, anti bullying, self defense, character development, health, diet and manners. We feel that these concepts emphasized on a regular basis will help the overall character development of the student.

 After the mat-chat, the next section of class is the practical learning section. This is where the children are split up based on age, size and ability to learn the traditional martial arts techniques that Total Ryu Martial Arts has to offer. These techniques consist of basic leg sweeps, hip throws (traditional jujitsu), strikes, blocks and striking combinations (traditional karate). We teach all of these ideas and principles from self-defense applications. For example, from a punch or a bear hug attack. This way, the child learns self-defense without learning aggressive behavior. We also include fun learning activities that emphasize a traditional jujitsu principles.

 

Our youth martial arts curriculum consists is a combination of tradition karate and Jujitsu. It contains dozens of different throwing and sweeping techniques along with striking, blocking, movement, falling and, of course, self-defense.  We find that this combination is great for children and gives a holistic approach to their self defense and martial arts skills.   For example Traditional jujitsu teaches advanced athletic, physical and mental ability along with mutual cooperation, asymmetrical learning, teamwork, and character development.  While traditional karate teaches balance, coordination, power, strength teamwork and character.  All of these benefits of Total Ryu kids martial arts classes are taught in a way that can’t be learned in any other traditional sporting activity.

Continued participation in Total Ryu Martial arts classes has been know to create strong, assertive young leaders who not only stand up for themselves but others.  They will also develop a “can do” attitude along with the following….";"N/A";"N/A";"MMA ";"N/A";"https://www.ftcollinsmartialarts.com/total-ryu-martial-arts-class-schedule/";"Monday: 4:15 PM - 8:30 PM

TRIALS was founded in 2010 by World Champion Ryan Schultz, along with professional fighters Ed Herman and Reed O’Malley.

In 2016, TRIALS underwent an ownership change when Ed Herman and Reed O’Malley looked to move on in their professional pursuits.  This opened the door for long time TRIALS MMA student and competitor, Jerrod Hardy, to fulfill a long time dream of his.

Carlos and Helio Gracie learned traditional Japanese Jiu Jitsu from Mithuyo Maeda from Kodokan, Japan. Traditionally, Japanese Jiu Jitsu (also spelled Jujutsu) was used to train for war purposes, not for sport. The Gracies changed all that! By combining their own unique talents with traditional moves, they were able to make one of the most popular combat sport categories in the world.

The number-one reason women are usually given for why they should train jiu jitsu is “because it teaches you how to protect yourself.”

There’s a good reason for it: jiu jitsu is designed for weaker, smaller opponents to dominate larger ones using technique rather than strength. Being as a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten every nine seconds and has a 1 in 5 chance of being raped in her lifetime, it would make sense that jiu jitsu would be a recommended form of self defense for a group of people that is (usually) smaller and weaker than the people most likely to assault them.

As someone who started jiu jitsu after nearly being sexually assaulted by a taxi driver about four years ago (and has since used it to get myself out of another sketchy situation), I’m a huge, huge proponent of anyone learning BJJ to protect themselves.

That said, jiu jitsu has so much more to offer than just self defense. You’ll get in shape, develop lifelong friendships, and have a lot of fun – and that’s only the beginning!

If you know a woman or are a woman who’s been thinking about stepping onto the mats, there are plenty of reasons to do it that don’t involve choking out would-be rapists.

1. It teaches you to love your body for what it can do rather than for what it looks like.

Both genders deal with the frustration of not having the “perfect” body, but the numbers are clear that women are much more likely to suffer from an eating disorder than men are in their lifetime.

Blame it on the media, society, whatever you’d like, but it’s clear that many women live their lives focusing on how small their waist is or how big their bust is or how their body doesn’t look like that body.

Jiu jitsu erases a lot of those insecurities by showing you all the awesome things your body can do. Do you have any idea how cool it is to choke someone out with the help of the thunder thighs you once hated? Do you know what it feels like to find out that you have ridiculously flexible shoulders that make you virtually un-kimura-able?

Jiu jitsu will show you, and it’s a lot more satisfying than any number that could show up on the scale. As an added bonus, all that exercise will get you closer to the hot bod you’ve always wanted, but by the time you make it there, you’ll be way more invested in your abilities than your appearance.

2. You don’t need to be big and strong to be good at it.

Yes, there are lots of women who are stronger, heavier, or taller than lots of men, but the vast majority of us are not. It can be really intimidating to walk into a martial arts gym and see really fit dudes beating the crap out of each other, but jiu-jitsu allows anyone to beat the crap out of anyone else. Isn’t that beautiful?

A lot of my non-BJJ friends think I’m lying when I tell them that I, a girl who is 5’2” on a tall day, can submit people who are literally twice my weight, but jiu-jitsu is all about technique overcoming brute strength. You don’t need to be a former championship wrestler or a beefed-up weightlifter to dominate your opponent. While that’s certainly good from a self-defense viewpoint, it’s also great for those of us who have lived our lives thinking that only large, muscly dudes can be successful in contact sports.

3. The sisterhood is like no other.

The people you train with in jiu jitsu are bound to become your non-biological family. It’s hard not to become close with someone when you’re sweating all over each other and place your safety in each other’s hands.

College sororities ain’t got nothin’ on the sisterly bonds that form on the mat.  

Because there are so few women in jiu-jitsu, the closeness that forms between jiujiteiras is even stronger than most friendships that are created in the gym. It’s rare to find women who are into what is unarguably a very masculine sport, and there’s something about the struggles of being female in a sea of testosterone that tends to bring women together.

It’s not just the ladies in your own gym that will grow to be your sisters, either. You’ll form an instant connection with female BJJ practitioners from other gyms and even the ones you compete against in tournaments.

Women in jiu-jitsu don’t tear each other down, they lift each other up – sometimes literally, if they can get the leverage just right.

4. It smashes ideas about what a woman “should” or “shouldn’t” do.

I’m not the type who burns bras (those things are expensive), but my blood pressure does go up a little every time I hear someone restrict an activity or behavior to a specific gender.

It blows my freaking mind that in the year 2016, women all across the globe are still being told either by the law or by society that regardless of their physical capabilities, they can’t or shouldn’t do certain activities that are traditionally “masculine.”

Jiu-jitsu is a giant middle finger to every time someone has scolded you for being unladylike or tried to put you in your “place” as a woman.

On the mats, everyone is equal; there is no gender. You will get your butt handed to you just as much as the men do, and you’ll also dish out a fair bit of butt-handing yourself.

As an added bonus, most of the men I’ve been lucky enough to meet in jiu-jitsu are also all about gender equality. Some of the newer guys might be weird about rolling with women, but those who have been around for a while will generally be good about treating you just as they would treat a man your size.

Whether or not you actively label yourself a feminist, gender equality should be something that we work towards all over the world. And luckily, jiu-jitsu is something that is practiced all over the world.

5. It makes you a positive role model for younger girls.

Throughout her childhood, a little girl will encounter all kinds of women that she will potentially look up to. When you’re a woman who does jiu-jitsu, you’re providing her with a role model who practices healthy habits, is disciplined, and can handle herself.

Jiu jitsu comes with plenty of benefits, and when you have a daughter, a niece, or any other young lady who wants to be you when she grows up, you pass on a lot of those benefits to her just by showing her what you do. You can give that little girl a head start on loving herself and making friends who genuinely care about her well-being.

Who knows? You might even convince her to get an early start on training!

While all of these are also great reasons for men to train BJJ as well, I know first-hand how intimidating it can be as a girl to take your first jiu-jitsu class surrounded by a bunch of tough dudes.

If you’re a woman facing the same situation, don’t back out due to fear. Jiu-jitsu has made me a better human being since I started, but more specifically, it’s made me more capable of facing the challenges that women are subjected to on a daily basis.

Whether you’re motivated by self defense or something completely different, it’s never a bad idea to put on that gi and take your first steps on an unforgettable journey.

Absolutely! Jiu Jitsu, which means “gentle art,” emphasizes the use of timing, positioning, technique and leverage to overcome brute strength and power; therefore, your child will not need to rely on size, strength, or aggression to excel. The regular practice of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu teaches Perseverance, Integrity, Courage and Responsibility. Your child will develop physical awareness, balance, flexibility, and coordination while strengthening the mental aspects of their personality by building self-esteem, discipline, confidence, and a good work ethic. The classes are taught in a positive, fun, and friendly manner, so your child will enjoy learning the art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

BENEFITS OF BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU FOR MY CHILD:

There are many benefits to the study of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It fosters positive changes in character that have beneficial effects in a wide set of contexts:

PERSEVERANCE + INTEGRITY + COURAGE + RESPONSIBILITY + FUN = KIDS BJJ

    BJJ cultivates Perseverance because students learn that to succeed and develop skill, they must try their best to do their best even when it is difficult, on a regular and consistent basis, time and time again; BJJ instills a strong work ethic because students quickly learn that there are no secret techniques that will substitute for hard work and sweat.
    BJJ teaches Integrity since students must be honest with themselves and others concerning what they do well and what they need to fix in order to excel.
    BJJ instills Courage by providing repeated opportunities for students to risk failure in order to achieve success; BJJ provides repeated opportunities to try; as a result, students grow emotionally and learn to confront and overcome the inevitable failures and mistakes that will occur in the course of training and competing.
    BJJ encourages Responsibility since students face opponents alone, both in training and in competition, but also encourages students to develop their ability to participate in a group working toward a common goal since students cannot progress in skill without a team of training partners upon whom they rely.
    BJJ is Fun because students get in shape and stay in shape and enjoy the confidence derived as a result by joining a community committed to self-improvement and surrounding themselves with the energy that comes from consistent positive change.";"http://www.bjjstapleton.com/ladies-bjj/";"BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU FOR WOMEN?

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is ideal for women.  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was created specifically to empower the smaller person to consistently overcome the bigger, stronger, more aggressive opponent.  When women are attacked they are often taken to the ground by a larger more aggressive assailant and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu effectively addresses this situation.

BJJ Stapleton is dedicated to bringing its students precise Brazilian Jiu Jitsu instruction. Women are welcome at all of our regularly scheduled classes and we pride ourselves on offering a fun, friendly, athletically challenging atmosphere which caters to anyone, women and men alike, looking to learn effective, authentic, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Additionally, we offer Ladies Only BJJ Classes which give women the opportunity to train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in classes for women, taught by women.

One organization that has done excellent things for Womens’ Jiu Jitsu is “Girls In Gis,” which offers free Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Seminars to introduce women to the amazing art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. BJJ Stapleton has been a proud participant in the Girls In Gis events ever since Girls In Gis held its very first event here in Colorado. This excerpt from the Girls in Gis Blog describes why Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is so great for women (the full blog entry can be found at: Girls In Gis: First Blog Post):

“I tried out a jiu-jitsu class that had one other girl… What I enjoyed about that first class was the variety of movements and techniques to learn. Plus the first week everyone lets you win so I was like, “Wow, I really submitted that huge guy, I rock!” [The other girl] and I trained together for a few months until she moved away never to return again. So then I was left with just me and a bunch of sweaty guys…

Somewhere along the way I quit caring that I was the only girl in the room and did actually start submitting guys without them letting me win. Do you know how much fun it is to have some spazzy guy coming at you with all of his might and just arm bar him over and over again? You don’t even have to do anything, the harder he tries the easier it is to submit him. That’s when I realized this sport is perfect for women. The benefits I have gained from training are limitless, but some of the big ones are self-defense, self-confidence and conditioning.

I’ll start with self defense. My friends are always asking me what I would do if someone attacked me. I don’t by any means think I could take on any attacker and I don’t know for sure what I would do, but I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t freak out. As long as I have my head I have a chance. I don’t think he could do anything to me that hadn’t been done to me in class. Jiu-jitsu teaches techniques based on leverage and teaches you how to use your opponents strength against them which is the perfect defense to someone bigger and stronger than you are.

Self-confidence. This right here is why I think every woman should take jiu-jitsu. To know that you are not weak and helpless. This realization has carried over into all areas of my life.

Finally, conditioning. Most people that know me wouldn’t believe this, but I hate to work out. That’s why I have found work outs that aren’t really work outs. Jiu-jitsu is way more fun than running or lifting weights. At first I was dying just trying to get through 1 round, but if you just keep doing it you learn to relax and eventually the cardio work sneaks up on you and you didn’t even realize you had done it…

Bullying – Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Martial Arts in general don’t just provide useful physical techniques or useful verbal scripts to learn to “deal” with a bully.

Jiu-Jitsu teaches us how to function in a social environment that may be stressful, more disciplined, and even at times violent. As an adult no martial art will ever be 100% safe. We think at times some martial arts even promote too much aggression where it would potentially escalate a situation.

Nowadays less physical interaction and social recognition is happening. Kids are sometimes hidden in their houses with their new Iphone, app, video game system, or whatever else it is that prevents them from playing outside recklessly. Coping skills from being isolated are just not there. 

Nowadays, even your child defending themselves can get them in just as much trouble, if not more, trouble these days. Throwing a punch to fend off a bully’s attack can even get your child suspended if not thrown out of schools. Even lead to some parents getting into legal litigation. 

Instead of learning from their friends or older friends in the neighborhood we have become isolated where many are forced to learn this through a Jiu-Jitsu program. Not just for self-defense, but their only means of comradery outside of the classroom.

Jiu-Jitsu for kids can help kids who are isolated by todays available mediums to actually engage and learn from one another on the mat.

This time may be limited to a few hours a week but beyond the techniques, this is the time where kids can get along together, learn from one another, while also learning and functioning as a team. 

So if your kid isn’t learning the latest technique to defeat that big bad bully, just be grateful your child is in a setting that is giving them the gift of interacting with kids in the area and teaching them how to communicate with other kids in an environment devoid of cell phones, television, and computers.

"The Kompound Training Center";"http://www.kompoundtrainingcenter.com/";" +1 303-222-0039";"4434 Cherokee Street";"Denver";"CO";80216;;"United States";"Brad Nicolarsen’s journey began in 1998 at just 14 years old when he started boxing. An avid participant in team sports such as basketball, he started looking for something more focused and was quickly drawn to boxing. As with everything he does, he threw himself heart and soul into the sport and soon found himself spending several hours a week at Brotherhood Boxing in Denver.

After a year of intensive training, he was introduced to the world of kickboxing and Muay Thai. He spent all of 1999 and 2000 focusing on Muay Thai training with renowned coach Oscar Martinez. From there it was a natural progression to look into the world of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which was rapidly gaining in popularity at the time.

In 2001 he trained with Dave Ruiz at Colorado BJJ, one of only two existing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gyms at that time. After going to school at CU Boulder, he switched to the other premiere BJJ gym, Easton Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and studied under Amal Easton. After moving to the West Coast in 2003, he earned his blue belt training under Juliano Prado.

By 2004, his need to move and to learn got the better of him and Brad decided to go to the source this time, moving to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, where he trained at the Gracie Barra Gym. Here he was able to learn directly from some of the top names in the sport, including Marcio Feitosa, Flavio Almeida, and Carl Inos. He worked endless hours, not only building his own skills but also having the extraordinary advantage of being able to watch many of the top black belts in the sport train.

Soon, he was back in the States, completing his education at CU and training once again with Dave Ruiz. He earned his purple belt in 2006 while helping Mike Nickels run his new Colorado BJJ Highlands Ranch school. From there he moved on to train further with Jorge Oliveira, one of a group of BJJ masters out of Rio who trained in Barra and become known as the Barra Brothers, and earned his brown belt in the spring of 2011. In July of 2012 after years of intense nonstop training, Brad was awarded his black belt by Jorge Oliveira.

By 2012, Brad decided it was time to open his own gym and in January of that year, he opened Littleton Kompound, still under the guidance of Jorge. As time went on, Brad’s noticed his students becoming more and more interested in pursuing higher level competition within the arena of competitive Brazilian jiu jitsu. Realizing he needed to have a registered black belt affiliated with his gym in order to meet IBJJF standards, he affiliated with Rafael Lovato – considered to be one of America’s greatest grapplers.

Since then Brad has been working to make the Kompound a premiere name in competitive Jiu-Jitsu training. He combined everything he had learned from the old school masters and put his own spin on it, bringing it in tune with the times. His hard work paid off when the Kompound was named 2015 Gym of the Year by the Lovato Association.

What makes Brad and his gym stand out is that he puts all the focus on the students. As he says, he’d rather train 100 champions than be a champion himself. That’s because he believes so passionately in passing on the knowledge that he’s gained and the love he has for the sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

And he applies that approach to every student who walks through his doors, no matter what their ultimate goal. Whether they’re looking to compete, learn self defense or just want to lose some weight, Brad wants every student to be the best he or she can possibly be and will work with them to achieve their goal.

To that end, he’s worked with everyone from collegiate wrestlers to UFC fighters to Olympic athletes, always with that philosophy of focusing on the student and passing on his knowledge in mind. Of course, in order to give his students everything they need he has to remain at the top of his own game, so he does continue his own training as well, but he has never been about self promotion and never will be.

And that’s a mindset that he passes along to his students along with their skills. Even with his students who do compete, he makes sure it’s not solely about winning a trophy or a medal but more about setting and achieving your personal goals. And that goal can be developing more self esteem, shedding an extra 50 pounds or gaining your next level belt… it’s all the same to Brad.

That’s why he’s set up the Kompound with various classes for different levels of expertise, from beginner to advanced, and even includes women’s classes and classes designed specifically to prepare students for competition. That way everyone who comes through his doors can get something out of the experience. And because he remembers how valuable it was for him to watch others train, he also includes All Levels classes, where athletes of different skill levels can come together and learn from each other.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is about competition but it’s so much more, and that’s what Brad loves about it. The old school traditions of BJJ are important to him and he wants to pass them along to the next generation of athletes. You can’t succeed without respecting where you came from and that means paying tribute to the foundations of the sport.

But BJJ is a living and changing discipline and Brad’s focus is on keeping the sport alive. In fact, Mixed Martial Arts is the fastest growing sport in the world today and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu holds a prominent spot within the MMA community. That is why Brad feels so strongly about being a part of spreading the word about BJJ. He wants every student who comes to his Kompound to feel as if they are a part of that incredible tradition too and to take BJJ into the future.";"http://www.kompoundtrainingcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kompound-logo-1.png";"http://www.kompoundtrainingcenter.com/kids-bjj/";"At the Kompound Training Center, we believe in training the right way, right from the start. It begins with our Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) Kids classes, open to boys and girls age 4-12. The classes are designed to help your children learn the basics of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and self defense, while improving their confidence and self esteem.

Everything at the Kompound Training Center is structured around an individual’s development level. While our class curriculum guides a student from one step to the next, within each class students receive carefully structured training, with skilled instructors, based on individual development. Students progress from one belt to another at their own pace so we are sure they are learning properly.

To ensure this, we have several instructors on the mat for each class with one-on-one instruction as they learn the basics for beginners. As children advance through the belts, students will be grouped together with one or two instructors overseeing each group. There will always be hands-on, skilled instruction from masters in the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, to maintain a safe, productive and enjoyable environment.

Our dedication to training is not something we take lightly. We believe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is more than a self defense skill; it’s a life skill that helps bolster a child’s self esteem and give them the skills they need by setting and working toward goals. With each goal met, there will be an increased sense of achievement, which can be quite empowering.

Children who may be facing challenges in their everyday lives can find a sense of purpose through learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Whether it’s bullying at school or simply building confidence in social situations, they’ll be able to face whatever comes their way knowing they are strong mentally and have the skills to defend themselves and overcome adversity.

If you’re looking for an activity that will be both fun and challenging for your children, our BJJ Kids classes may just be the ticket. For your child, and you. It’s never too soon to start improving yourself. Anyone can get something out of our Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training, so why not start your child off on the right foot? Kids classes are where the journey to self-awareness begins.";"http://www.kompoundtrainingcenter.com/womens-bjj/";"At Kompound Training Center we believe the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is something that should be experienced by everyone, regardless of age or gender. Not only is it a fun way to stay fit, it’s also a great way to learn discipline and practice self-defense. Our Women’s classes help female students of all experience levels to enter the world of BJJ.

The Women’s classes focus on all the same principles that are covered in the Fundamentals and All Levels classes. You’ll learn the basic moves, discover how to connect them together into a smooth series of moves and put your Jiu-Jitsu training to work for you. If you’re serious about competing or if you just want to learn an effective form of self-defense, this is the perfect way to do it.

Why have a separate class just for women? The difference is preference. It is the same curriculum taught in the Fundamentals and All Levels classes, just taught by female instructor and a dedicated environment. Offering a class that caters to those interested in learning about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, as well as, a building a community environment intended to promote greater participation by women of all ages and experience levels in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.";"Muay Thai, MMA, Kickboxing";"N/A";"http://www.kompoundtrainingcenter.com/denver-schedule/";"N/A";"Brad Nicolarsen";" -Kids 12 and under now train for free at the Kompound!

We have a few simple goals here. However, we put 110% of our effort into achieving them. In short, these goals have but one purpose:

To give you the best possible martial arts training experience we possibly can. Everything we do works toward this goal. Here's the breakdown:

Expertise.
We strive to achieve the greatest levels of expertise in martial arts that we can. That way, we'll have answers to every one of your questions. We'll have experience and knowledge to help you with every one of your challenges. And wisdom to teach you each technique in the most efficient, effective, and enjoyable way.

Safety.
From our professional equipment, to the design of our facility - everything is geared toward keeping you safe and injury-free. That way your martial arts experience will be as fun and enjoyable as possible. From stretching every limb of your body, to promoting support and friendship amongst all of our students, we promise to keep you safe and sound.

Confidence. Discipline. Focus.
We strive to not just teach you the raw techniques of martial arts - but to help you uncover its ancient wisdom to better your life. From greatly increasing your self-confidence, to learning how to use your time more efficiently, to developing laser-like focus to go after all of your goals (both in martial arts, and in life)... we aim to guide you through the ancient teachings of martial arts to help you in all areas of your life.

Cleanliness.
Our facility is cleaned daily to create a productive, enjoyable atmosphere. We take no shortcuts in cleaning to insure that you, and all of our students, stay healthy. 
 Support.
We're here for you in every way we can be. If you need extra guidance in learning techniques... or any struggles with your martial arts training... we're here to consult, console and help you. This emphasis on support creates a bond between student and teacher. It also creates an atmosphere of support among fellow students - who will be glad to help you in any way that they can, too.

Fun.
And lastly, we strive to make our martial arts training as fun as possible. After all, all work and no play is simply boring. Each class is infused with light-hearted moments to break up the intense focus and concentration. That way you get the perfect balance of serious focus, and light fun. From lion cubs to children - fun play has been used for thousands of years as a powerful teacher. Now, as you embark in the new challenge of martial arts, it'll help you learn and absorb in a way that makes it easy to keep coming back.

Mile High Gracie has been operating in Denver, Colorado since the year 2000; originally founded by Royce Gracie black belt and professional MMA coach, John Crouch. Around 2007, Morgan Patnode took over the academy as head instructor after Crouch departed Colorado to coach at The MMA Lab in Glendale, AZ. Morgan Patnode was a dedicated student under Crouch and earned his black belt from him. Several of our other instructors also trained under Crouch as well.

We are a homegrown business, not part of a chain that is focused on the bottom-line. We are a community and family-oriented academy that is centered around the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Our Lakewood location provides some of the best jiu-jitsu and grappling training within close proximity to several Colorado Front-range areas and cities such as, Denver, Wheat Ridge, Englewood, Arvada, Lakewood, Littleton, Westminster, Green Mountain, Broomfield, Golden and Evergreen.

Our class schedule, flexible and low rate membership options provide an accessible way to train and can accommodate a variety of lifestyles.
Our Art

We train in authentic Brazilian Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Jiu-Jitsu is a self-defensive art for everyone, not just for MMA fighters. It revolves around decades of developed and evolved techniques around grappling (chokes, joint locks, submissions, and take-downs), self-defense and other aspects of martial arts. Jiu-Jitsu requires little effort in its purest form when your technique is refined. In addition to self-defense, it is excellent for physical strength, flexibility, cardio, mental health, discipline, confidence, and overall general health. More history of Jiu-Jitsu →
Our Training

At Mile High Gracie, everyone participates in “live training” with all belt levels. There are no specified prerequisites to train in any of our classes. Live training is just one aspect that sets Gracie Jiu-Jitsu apart from other martial arts. In our jiu-jitsu classes, we focus on controlled grappling (submissions, joint locks, chokes, etc.), self-defense, and take-downs – this includes both defensive and offensive techniques. We do cover striking aspects of fighting (punches, elbows, knees & kicks) and provide defensive techniques around striking, but during sparring/rolling, we do not throw strikes unless it is a special training exercise with advanced level students and instructors.

Our Attitude

If you’re new to the art, there is nothing to be intimidated of at Mile High Gracie. Jiu-Jitsu is an art that allows anybody to be able to participate and be successful at. Nobody at Mile High Gracie has attitude or ego and it is NOT tolerated. We believe in hard work, good health, safety, helping others, respect, discipline, dedicated learning, passionate instruction, honesty, and humbleness.

A better working body; a sharper, more focused mind; a stronger sense of self confidence; more self discipline; the ability to physically defend yourself — who wouldn’t want these things for themselves?

Practicing martial arts at Seo's Martial Arts Academy in Arvada, CO is about physical fitness, character development (self-esteem, self confidence, focus and concentration, self discipline) and self defense, not just kicking and punching.

People often think that martial arts is about fighting, but that’s not what we emphasize at Arvada Martial Arts. Instead, we focus on the personal development aspects of martial arts because that’s why most people participate.

Almost half of the 6 million participants in martial arts are children ages 6-17, according to statistics from the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. And it’s not unusual for the whole family to get involved — about one-third of the students are adults.

No matter what discipline of martial arts you choose, whether it is karate, kung fu, taekwondo, jujitsu, judo, aikido, tai chi, kendo or another one of the many forms of martial arts, the styles may differ, but the benefits remain the same.

Universal Benefits of Martial Arts

For a list of specific benefits for various age groups, visit the adult and children program pages on this site. Here are some universal benefits of martial arts:

Improved physical fitness: Make no mistake. Martial arts is a great workout! It is a total body workout — your stamina, muscle tone, flexibility, balance and strength will all show signs of improvement.

Enhanced self-esteem: By learning these skills and improving your physical condition, you become more comfortable in all situations — whether you’re in danger or simply doing a task that takes you beyond your comfort zone. Kids have a new sense of self confidence, making them virtually “bully proof.”

Increased focus and concentration: From the very first day of class, students are challenged to think as much as they act. Learning the forms and movements reinforces working memory. That’s why the Mayo Clinic specifically counts the marital arts of karate and taekwondo among the effective therapies for ADD and ADHD.

Increased social skills: Martial arts strongly emphasize self discipline and self control as a core component of its teachings. Self leadership and the ability to deal with others in a mature way is the result.

Stress relief: Kicking, punching and screaming are a great release, no matter what your age.

Respect for values: Honesty, courtesy, integrity, perseverance and excellence are some curriculum areas of focus. These qualities help both children and adults become great leaders.";"https://res.cloudinary.com/display97/image/upload/q_auto,fl_lossy,f_auto/v1362515922/g9q8lahk81wr15msmnln.png";"http://seosmartialartsacademy.com/classes/Kids-Martial-Arts";"Kids Martial Arts Classes

Whether your goal is to learn self-defense, become a professional fighter, be a tournament Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu / submission grappling champion, or just get in shape while having fun; we can help you meet your goals!!

What is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the single most effective martial art around. It relies on the use of leverage and technique to apply a joint lock or choke hold to subdue an attacker. By relying on technique and leverage it gives the smaller person the ability to overcome a larger, stronger attacker.

Why Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?

90% of all real street fights end up on the ground! Not knowing what to do in a combat situation could be a nightmare or worse yet, life threatening. We have it down to a science on how to win a fight, step by step. And we have been doing it successfully for the past 80 years. It is not our intention to prove we are the toughest people in the world, but rather to show that our martial art works time and time again with devastating effectiveness. What if you have to protect yourself against someone who is bigger, stronger, and hits harder than you do? If you want to exchange punches and kicks you may not stand a chance. What if they muscle you to the ground and start punching you? Bad news if you have never learned Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which effectively addresses an aggressive assailant and ground grappling.

Would it benefit my child?

Absolutely! Jiu-Jitsu, which means “gentle art”, emphasizes the use of technique and leverage. Therefore, your child will not have to rely on size, strength, or speed. Also they will learn, to defend themselves and subdue their opponent in a safe and humane way without having to rely on kicks and punches.Martial Arts will help your child develop physical awareness of balance, reflexes, flexibility, and coordination. Martial arts and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu are great for building the mental aspects of their personality such as self-esteem, discipline, confidence, compassion, and good work ethic. The kids BJJ classes are taught in a positive, fun, and friendly manner, so your child will enjoy learning the martial art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

What about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for women?

BJJ is ideal for women. For the simple fact that when most women are attacked they are taken to ground and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was created for the smaller, weaker person. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu effectively addresses the situation where your assailant is the aggressor. We can learn how and where to strike someone, but what if we fail under pressure or miss our opportunity because of a surprise attack? It is certainly not time to give up. With Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, you do have a second chance!";"http://thesanctuarybjjandfitness.com/wp-content/themes/cbjj/images/logo.png";"http://thesanctuarybjjandfitness.com/classes-2/";"The kids martial arts program consists of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Judo. We combine these two martial arts for the best results. 2004 Olympian, Charlee Minkin, teaches judo while Rigan Machado Black Belt, Ben Lowry teaches Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Your kids will learn basic self-defense techniques as well as break falls, takedowns (throws), and submissions.

Waza Ju-Jitsu is a hybrid grappling based affiliation that is geared towards self-defense and combat sports.

Judo and Jiu-Jitsu are not only Sport and Self defense systems but are also tools and aids to help us navigate through life and build a better version of ourselves.

Long ago judo split from Japanese Jujitsu to and become more focused on the stand up battle… This led to the birth of  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu which was more focused on the ground aspect. We work as a melting pot to bring these two forces back together with the added influence of other combative sports to create the hybrid system we call Waza Ju-Jitsu…with the traditional influence and the evolution of combat, we are what you are looking for.

Fundamentals (Beginners)
The Fundamentals program is our introductory program into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In this program you'll learn the basic moves you'll need for the rest of your Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu life. We'll teach you basic and effective techniques from all major positions within Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu; guard top, guard bottom, side-control top, side-control bottom, mount top, mount bottom, back control and back defense. The Fundamentals program rotates every three months (12 weeks) and each week we work on one of the six, major positions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Over the course of 12 weeks you'll attend at least two different classes, drilling each position thoroughly.
The Fundamentals program is divided into two seperate programs. In Fundamentals 1 we will fill your mind with elemantary techniques and drills. We will push you to do as many classes as possible so your basics are solid and your game is fundamentally sound! Approximately three months after you start, you will move on to Fundamentals 2 where you will still work on improving your fundamentals and technique, but you will also start training in our Organized Sparring sessions, Here we'll allow you to put practice into play. You'll do so in a safe, controlled setting under the close supervision of one of our instructors.";"N/A";"N/A";"Cardio Kickboxing,Thai Boxing";"N/A";"https://www.busybjj.com/schedule";"Monday: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM

A Way of Life

The core belief and driving force at our school is that martial arts is a way of life. It is not a sport. The goal is to build the person and help them reach their full, true potential. The primary philosophy is that a true martial artist must be in total harmony with mind, body, and spirit. This is done through physical training and mental discipline in the combative arts. Being a warrior and knowing how to defend yourself is very important at our school. Of more importance however, is the growth of one's true self, the spirit if you will.


Training at Our School

Traditional martial arts is the back bone of training at our school. Our core style is moo duk kwan taekwondo (moo duk kwan means ""school of martial virtue""). We also place value in the improvement and evolution of training. Therefore, we blend our traditional taekwondo with other styles such as jiu jitsu, judo, karate, silat, arnis, qi gong and common sense street self-defense. The traditions of respect and discipline are absolute standards of behavior at Spirit Warrior Martial Arts Academy, both encouraged and enforced in every class.


The Spirit Warrior Difference

Spirit Warrior Martial Arts is not your typical strip mall taekwondo school. It is not just another watered down martial arts school as is so prevalent in America today. In a time when belt advancements are so readily handed out like candy, you can be assured that at our school, you will not be allowed to advance in rank until you are truly ready. This especially holds true for the rank of black belt. Black belt means you are in effect an expert mentally, physically and spiritually in your art, and that you can readily defend yourself in most any situation. In addition , it also holds that simply being the toughest fighter on the planet in and of itself does not mean you are worthy of a black belt. A true black belt also knows how to avoid a fight. At the Spirit Warrior Martial Arts Academy, to earn a black belt you must also show that you have the self-control and compassion of a true warrior.

The answer very simply is because nothing builds strong character in your child better than martial arts. Parents report that their kids get better grades, have become more polite and respectful, and have made tremendous improvements in their self-confidence. Contrary to popular belief, it does not teach kids to be violent. Studies have shown the exact opposite to be true. Martial arts in fact decreases aggressive behavior.


Confidence

Martial Arts gives your child the skills and confidence to say ""no"" to and avoid negative influences. When you involve your son or daughter in martial arts, you are equipping them to better handle difficult situations. You are giving them the power to face the future and a difficult world. And finally, when all else fails, you are providing them the ability to defend themselves when they must.

Our children’s classes focus more on our 3 rules: Self Discipline, Self Control, and Respect for others. This way they can develop the ability to control their bodies and behavior, be responsible and pick up after themselves, as well as be polite and well mannered towards adults and peers alike. Also, by utilizing positive reinforcement techniques, students will be building their self esteem and self confidence so they can resist unhealthy peer pressure and have a positive self image. With their martial arts training we tailor our teaching methods to each group and ability level in order to keep classes exciting, fun, and motivating.

Our instructors have not only mastered their Martial arts abilities, but are trained to teach children. Simply being a Black belt does not automatically make someone an excellent instructor, which is why our professional instructors receive weekly training on teaching methods, motivation techniques, and other vital skills so children and adults alike receive the best experience on the path to becoming a Black Belt.

As students progress through the curriculum, they will earn colored belts and awards. Unlike many schools, our program is designed such that children set achievable goals and make regular progress throughout their training.

Whether you’re an adult looking for the fastest way to get in shape, a kid in need of confidence, or an MMA professional looking to take it to the next level, Tiger Schulmann’s is right for you.

During the last 30 years, Tiger Schulmann’s has trained over 200,000 students and grown to almost 50 locations. Our proprietary Martial Arts programs provide adults and children with proven physical and mental training to further their health and wellness. Through physical conditioning, self-defense instruction, and consistency, Tiger Schulmann’s martial arts training will boost your energy and increase your confidence. Explore the site to find a program that’s right for you.

Tiger Schulmann’s instructors keep you motivated with fun classes, personalized one-on-one instruction, and nutritional guidance to help you reach your goals.

Every Tiger Schulmann’s school is owned by an instructor with over 10 years of high level martial arts training. They still train with Master Tiger Schulmann and his brother Ron, every week. They then take back that knowledge to their own students. As far as self-defense, some instructors are MMA champions, proving that Tiger Schulmann’s training is incredibly effective if you ever have to use it.

There are other martial arts schools and many other activities you can do but Nothing Else is Tiger Schulmann’s.";"https://tsk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/logo-tiger-schulmanns.png";"https://tsk.com/kids/martial-arts/";"

The benefits of martial arts for children is well documented. There is conclusive proof that martial arts training improves focus, discipline, fitness, and builds confidence.
Nothing else is Tiger Schulmann’s

Long before Mixed Martial Arts became popular, Master Daniel “Tiger” Schulmann and his instructors blended the most effective martial arts styles and added their own advancements. They studied child psychology and developed a fun curriculum to strengthen physical and mental development and keep children eager to learn more.

Today, nothing has changed. Even after 30 years, Master Schulmann and all the Tiger Schulmann’s instructors continue innovating to bring their students the best, most effective curriculum possible.
A history of success

Unlike other kids martial arts classes, Tiger Schulmann’s has proven results for more than 30 years. We have watched confident kids grow up to be confident adults. They have the ability to succeed

Former and present students include: Ivy Leaguers, successful doctors, lawyers, teachers, scientists, MMA champions and everything in between. Tiger Schulmann’s helped them get there.
Tiger Schulmann’s instructors are trained to teach

Just because someone is great at something does not necessarily mean that they are great teachers. Often, highly acclaimed doctors, actors, pilots – and those from all other careers and endeavors – lack the ability to teach others. Being an instructor is a separate, additional skill to master. Any teaching system needs to include a process for training and developing the best teachers. Tiger Schulmann’s has been dedicated to doing exactly that for decades.

Each location is owned and run by a dedicated Tiger Schulmann’s instructor with a minimum of 10 years of high-level martial arts and child psychology training. Each instructor still trains every week with Master Daniel “Tiger” Schulmann and his brother Ron, an 8th degree black belt. The instructors then bring back that knowledge to teach their students. Every instructor started as a Tiger Schulmann’s student themselves, with similar hurdles that Tiger Schulmann’s helped them overcome.
Proven at the highest levels

Tiger Schulmann’s MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) Team championship belts are very impressive. It shows that self-defense and bully prevention techniques really work. It is also inspiring to all of our students to see what the top level students are accomplishing.

But all students are different – and competition may not be what everyone wants to do. Or something they may want to do later on. That’s fine. There is flexibility in how you train with us. Some may need to be eased into things without pressure, while others may need a push to become more motivated and committed. Our instructors know that – it’s what they are skilled in doing.
See for yourself

Check out all our parent and student testimonials. Every kid started just like yours can right now. Their first step was with a call to make an appointment for complimentary free class. Once there with their own child, parents will talk to other parents whose kids have been going to classes for a while. They can see the martial arts skill these kids have during practice – and their parents can also tell them about the difference martial arts training has made in so many other areas of their child’s life.

Most of all, our classes are fun! Kids can’t wait to come to their class. They will go home and want to practice, and show everyone what they have accomplished. They will know that their skills belong to them, and their training will make them feel confident and powerful.

Tiger Schulmann’s is, quite simply, the best martial arts for kids.

Master Marcio “Macarrao” Stambowsky is the only 8th degree red and white belt in the northeast under the legendary Rolls Gracie Sr. With a heritage as deep as ours, you will get to experience firsthand authentic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu right from its source.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a grappling-based martial art that teaches its students to control resisting opponents in ways that force him/her to submit. Generally, gaining this control is easier on the ground than in a standing position. This is why much of the techniques in BJJ are centered around the skill of taking an opponent to the ground and wrestling for dominant positions, rendering the opponent harmless.

The main principals behind BJJ are to control and overcome the obstacles of greater size, strength and aggression. This is done by utilizing superior leverage, grip, and position upon your opponent. Students gain a deep understanding of the workings and limits of the human body. The knowledge can be used to subdue and control an opponent with whatever level of severity the student chooses.";"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59716885cf81e00a7f7f8294/t/597168f8be6594f000b60588/1519409727432/?format=1500w";"https://www.graciesportsusa.com/kids-martial-arts-1/";"Authentic Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for Kids

Martial Arts teaches self-discipline and socialization skills. Many parents whose children have ADHD report great success and improvement with Martial Arts training, because self-control and concentration (among many other skills) are learned and practiced during our classes. These are some of the skills that children, and especially those with ADHD and some Spectrum Disorders, need to work on. Children who train in Martial Arts typically perform better at school and at home.
We welcome all levels, regardless of ability and rank (from other Martial Arts schools). We have mixed level classes and we adapt our instruction to accommodate everyone. We do offer classes designed especially for advance belt training.

Classes are high-energy, focused, structured, dynamic, and action-packed! We offer a variety of Martial Arts styles and incorporate a combination of them into our classes, keeping students interested and motivated. Fun, energetic classes help increase cardiovascular fitness and health, focus, concentration, discipline, balance, and coordination.

Martial Arts is one of the few athletics that is not seasonal, and is offered year round. We have ongoing admission, where you can sign up and join a class any time throughout the year. Martial Arts is a great way to keep kids involved in a constructive activity all year long.

We are available for demonstrations at schools, fairs, corporations, etc. We are always willing and able to start up new programs!

About Our Classes

Assembly of the Martial Arts Academy is dedicated to teaching Mixed Martial Arts to students of all ages. Elements of Tae Kwon Do, Karate, Jujitsu, Ground Grappling, Aikido, Judo, Western Boxing, Kick-Boxing, and Cardio Kick-Boxing are included to provide a comprehensive set of skills and techniques.

At registration, a student would receive a white belt with his or her uniform. From there, the student would progress through the ranks, earning different colored belts, until he or she reaches the ultimate goal of being a Black Belt. Testing for each new belt level promotes hard work, dedication, goal-setting, and commitment. Students feel more confident and experience a huge sense of pride and accomplishment upon earning a new belt.

Background

The philosophy of our Young Lions Children’s Program is to help build life skills for your child through the martial arts by instilling excellence of the mind and body, confidence, a sense of achievement, self-discipline, and self-defense skills.

Ideal Student

Renzo Gracie Training Facility
YOUNG LIONS PROGRAM

Introduction:
160,000 kids miss school every day because they fear bullies.
Bullying causes depression and lowers self-esteem.
To “Bully proof” your child, you must build their confidence by teaching them self-defense.
Fathers in the Gracie Family have been “Bully proofing” their kids for three generations.
These programs will enable us to “Bully proof” your child.

The Curriculum:
Young Cubs Games: We introduce your child to the fundamental principles of Jiu-Jitsu by playing these fun games.
Rules of Engagement : Before introducing your child to the Young Lions techniques, teach them the Rules of Engagement so they know precisely when they can and can’t use the techniques.
Young Lions : This course features all the Jiu-Jitsu techniques formatted for the children. Once you child perfects these techniques, their confidence will skyrocket.

The Golden Rule:
The Golden Rule: Expect nothing, praise everything.
When your expectations are too high, kids will associate Jiu-Jitsu with their inadequacy.
As soon as your expectations exceed your child’s abilities, they will quit.
Nothing matters more than having your child start and end each lesson with a smile.

Transfer Teaching:
Stimulates growth through positive reinforcement.
Patience is the key to success in the early stages of learning.
Trust that, in time, the system will take its course and the child will learn.

The Critical Challenge:
Keeping your child engaged for several years will be your challenge.
Level 3 intensity is different for every child, and it will change as the child gets older.
Use strategic sacrifices to get the child excited about training.
The possibility of defeat sweetens the taste of victory.

Preserving the Privilege:
If you can make training a privilege, you win.
To make it a privilege, make them “earn” the daily training sessions.
NEVER make attendance for your child mandatory because then their heart won’t be in it.
If they lose interest, give it a break then bring them back to the Young Cubs Class.
At RGTF we change lives and strengthen character. We take this responsibility very seriously.
Never allow your child to quit something because they don’t want to do it. This type of training for your child should be a major life changing decision.
By allowing your child to give up, not only are you letting a child make a major life changing  decision, but you are also showing them that it is ok to give up.

Getting Started:
Reading the Welcome Booklet is a great way to getting started. Within the booklet it explains all  the clothing requirements, rules and regulations, attendance, and lastly it goes over each  individual martial art to provide the parents with prior insight as to what your child will be  learning.
• Jiu-Jitsu uniforms, both rashguards and Gi’s can be purchased in our store.

The Belt Testing Process:
• Your child will start as a white belt and we document every class they take.
We will award your child a stripe around every 20 classes.
• Once they have earned four stripes, they will advance to the next belt.
There is no correlation between belt promotions and training courses.

The Critical Connection:
Kids naturally rebel against parental authority in their teenage years.
One way to undermine the rebellion is to become a source of positivity for your child.
Use this program to increase the positivity and strengthen the bond with your child.

The Gracie Diet:
If your child learns to live healthier at an early age, then avoiding life’s temptations will be much easier.
Leading by example is the most powerful way to influence your child.
To Grand Masters Carlos and Helio Gracie, nothing was more important than Jiu-Jitsu, other than Gracie Diet.

The “Well Rounded” Benefit:
We work closely with parents and schools to focus on any issues your child may be having in any  area of life.
Please don’t hesitate to bring any issues your child may be encountering to the program director  or any of the instructors.
At Renzo Gracie Training Facility we are a family oriented Facility, if we can do our part to create  a safer and healthier life for your child, then we will do all it takes to reach that expectation.

Established in 1975, the Academy believes in traditional values. We teach the classical art of Tang Soo Do Mi Guk Kwan (The American School of the Way of the Empty Hand Defense) which was founded by Grandmaster and chief instructor Charles J. Ferraro. We augment our training in Tang Soo Do with the art of Hai Dong Gumdo (the Way of the Korean Sword), Aikido, Jui-jutsu, Tai Chi and Philippine Martial Arts (Kali, Escrima, Arnis).

We are not bound or limited by outdated traditions and methods that are no longer effective. We believe in fostering the principles of respect and discipline, long considered cornerstones for the martial arts. In this manner our students can fulfill the purpose of our art, that being the development of every aspect of the ""self"". This will result in an individual who totally integrates his/her intellect, body, emotions and spirit. This integration helps to create a person who is free from inner conflict and who can deal with the outside world in a mature, intelligent, forthright and virtuous manner.";"https://az12497.vo.msecnd.net/6b373b09ceae4e74947d73dc35820436/logo/whak_logo_r2.png";"https://www.whakonline.com/SocialSite/kids-program";"We here at the West Haven Academy of Karate are very concerned with the well-being and education of our children. We understand that younger students have shorter attention spans than the typical adult student. Our unique children's program uses interesting and enjoyable methods to keep the student's attention and to teach our young students skills that they can use for life.

    We promote non-violent resolution to conflict. Our methods help children to explore and understand the conflicts that can confront them in their lives.
    Children will learn confidence, self-discipline and self-control as they learn to act and react to the world around them.
    Our young students are treated with respect and are taught to return the same respect to others.
    We believe in praise, encouragement and positive reinforcement. We have incentives for good academic report cards, which we have termed our ""Academic Achievement Program"". We encourage our students to maintain good academic grades, impressing upon them the importance of balancing their physical, as well as, their mental growth.
    We teach our students the value of making goals and working towards meeting them. In this way we can assist them in getting into the achievement / self esteem spiral. The more they achieve the greater their self-esteem. The greater their self-esteem the more they want to achieve.

Muay Thai has previously been considered a male-dominated sport, but times are changing and women are coming into the cage to learn this fascinating and invigorating martial art. Muay Thai for women is a strong physical fitness program coupled with the ancient art of Muay Thai (Thai Boxing). Women are finding this opportunity to be opening up to them in a big way as many martial arts facilities are taking a hard look at the classes they offer and learning how to reach a larger demographic.

muay thai for womenWomen are engaged in fitness programs to lose weight, gain strength, feel better about themselves, develop a fit and healthy body, gain self-esteem and self confidence. Muay Thai for women provides all these attributes and more as one becomes involved in a local class or facility/gym wherein other women have gathered to learn the skills needed in Muay Thai.
Muay Thai Is…

Muay Thai is known as Thai Boxing and was originally practiced as a combat sport in Thailand. Just like all the martial arts forms, Muay Thai requires a certain degree of mental and physical stamina. A Muay Thai competitor must have an excellent level of physical fitness and mental capacity to focus and plan out their moves.

It is a combat sport that is practiced standing up (unlike wrestling) and uses the power and speed of fists, elbows, knees, shins, and feet. Muay Thai for women takes you from the very first steps of learning skills and builds upon those skills to create a strong foundation as you move forward in your lessons.
Where to Find Muay Thai for Women

With the advent of more women looking to improve their physical fitness and have fun while doing it, away from the typical circuit gyms that encourage treadmills and stationary bicycles…women are coming into the martial arts arena for a better workout. They have found extreme satisfaction in working on these skills, learning self-defense, and building a stronger and more flexible body that is able to withstand the effects of aging.

muay thai for womenLooking for Muay Thai for Women is as easy as a web search in your locale, talking to friends that may all ready be using a local facility, and of course, the old stand by, the telephone book. Many martial arts facilities have enlarged their class offerings to provide women with women-only instruction in various forms of martial arts, Muay Thai included.

It is commonly understood that many women can feel intimidated by this male dominated sport yet want desperately to try themselves in learning the skills offered in Muay Thai for women. Being able to engage in class taught for and even BY women in Muay Thai takes the uncomfortableness away and allows women to focus on their personal skills and achievements without feeling out of place amongst the men.

Research local facilities that offer martial arts in your area, see if they offer Muay Thai for women, and then make time to go and visit the facility during a class period. You will want to watch how the other women are engaged with the instructor, watch how the trainer teaches the class, see how well the facility is set up and what options are available to you.

Muay Thai classes can be a bit loud but there should be an overall calm and comfort level involved that makes the classes accessible and enjoyable. You want to get started in a class at a facility that you feel comfortable with so that you will continue to attend and build on the skills being taught.
Find Your Place to Learn Muay Thai

Muay Thai is an amazing workout and provides so much more than just a fitness program. Whether you are looking to learn self-defense techniques, lose weight, gain strength, or whether you have thoughts of being able to compete with other women in Muay Thai, you owe it to yourself to find a suitable martial arts facility that you can call home.

muay thai for womenTake your time getting to know the facilities in your area and ask questions about the instructors, the class schedule, and the options available at the facilities you look at. Remember to visit the facility at least once while a Muay Thai for women class is in progress in order to find out if that particular class feels right to you. Choose wisely as these are the students and trainer that you will be working with. You want to feel comfortable with the people around you and you need to be able to trust and believe in your instructor.

We are one of the longest continuously running Martial Arts Schools in America having produced countless masters who now operate their own schools across the country!  Located centrally in East Hartford, CT, students from all over central Connecticut and Southern Massachusetts regularly practice their martial art at our school.  Our children's classes provide confidence and discipline, and our adult classes provide exceptional self-defense and health benefits.  All of our instructors were personally trained by Grandmaster Moo Yong Lee!
 
Grandmaster Moo Yong Lee is well-known and highly regarded by the worldwide Taekwondo community. He was the 42nd Black Belt in all of Tae Kwon Do.  He was recognized by his fellow instructors as a man of great integrity and dedication. One of the elite individuals who hold the rank of 9th degree Black Belt issued by Kukkiwon (the World Taekwondo Headquarters), Grandmaster Moo Yong Lee is one of the very few Grandmasters of Taekwondo residing in the United States. He was the president of the United States Taekwondo Union (USTU) in 1985-1986 and was the current president of the United States Taekwondo Instructors Union (USTIU).

He began his study in Korea at an early age. Today, over seventy years later, he is widely acknowledged as one of the foremost martial artists in the world. Grandmaster Lee always humbly considered himself to be a student of his beloved art. Teaching with kindness and humor at the East Hartford, Connecticut school he founded in 1974, this busy instructor always found time to give each of his students his individual attention and guidance, seeing our potential even before we could. Training under Grandmaster Lee's direction proceeded in a no-nonsense atmosphere of maximum effort and mutual respect. A natural leader through his own example of total commitment and hard work, those students fortunate enough to have studied with Grandmaster Lee agree that the value of his instruction extends far beyond the training hall.

We support a team atmosphere and create a comfortable learning experience for all ability levels from beginner to expert

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is an art based in ground fighting. Along with this, it teaches takedowns, takedown defense, ground control, and especially submissions. Submissions refer to holds that either cut off an opponent’s air supply (chokes) or look to take advantage of a joint (such as armbars).

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighters tend to feel very comfortable fighting from a position called the guard, if need be. The guard postion in essence, wrapping one's legs around an opponent to limit their movement is what allows them to fight from their backs so effectively, and is also something that separates their art from most other grappling styles.";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/b8164cfe78912151838ef4a3514231e1?AccessKeyId=DB3F918D7E3C3A70AF8C&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://www.roninbrazilianjiujitsu.com/kids.html";"In our Kids Programs, we instill in our students the qualities that will help them throughout their lives.

The initial program focused on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, in a time when BJJ schools were few and far between in New England, as well as the Israeli art of Krav Maga which was largely unknown at the time.  In August of 2005 MSDC opened a 7200 square foot facility in Middletown, CT and expanded its programming: now there were multiple daily classes offering Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu both with and without the gi (uniform), Bruce Lee’s Jeet Kune Do, and Mixed Martial Arts.  In addition to all this, MSDC began offering a free self-defense class for members of the community that met every Thursday night (this class ran from 2005 – 2012, every Thursday).

seminar MSDC began attracting notable expert guests:  annual visits from world-renowned Jeet Kune Do, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Filipino Martial Arts, and Self-Defense expert Mr. Roy Harris, seminars from notable BJJ standout Mr. Roy Dean, workshops from movement expert Dr. Mark Cheng, rare training opportunities in the art of Kalis Ilustrisimo from Mr. Romy Macapagal, an MMA seminar with UFC veteran Mr. Jason Lambert, and a number of other workshops including Sayoc Kali, Boxe Francaise Savate, Aikido, Wing Chun, and more.

During these years, MSDC flourished and provided training to hundreds of people in the greater Middletown Area.  Additional programs grew, including the Adaptive Movement Martial Arts program for kids, and the Boxe Francaise Savate French Kickboxing classes (including two trips to Montreal to train with Kickboxing legend Mr. Richard Sylla).

In 2012, Chris Martell was offered a second chance at one of his major personal goals  (a return to the world of Professional Ballroom Dancing), so a team of MSDC’s top talent assumed direction of the facility.  MSDC soon moved to Meriden, CT, into a beautiful facility that was well-designed to accommodate the growing number of group and private classes.  MSDC began training more athletes, including its first Professional Mixed Martial Arts competitor.  A growing number of outside life changes for the management team members forced the team to close the official facility in 2014; however, MSDC’s programs live on. Group classes take place at Adaptive Movement Parkour’s gorgeous and sprawling facility at 60 Peter Court, New Britain, CT.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p320x320/601279_10151346288031747_1426307427_n.jpg?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeE8mUw3n82kLuwSiZmxWgbqezX_cdYz75p3Byya3qJyDZNHSUtNPcRNG_HFjcNge2xj7wTQKfnrsy4wAlyBakwzRqmvv097wtliurSpWdlFwQ&oh=9ee9f162f1796d54811d71631d877084&oe=5B082017";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Kickboxing, MMA";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Chris Martell";"N/A";"Chris@ModernSelfDefense.com";"https://www.facebook.com/ModernSelfDefenseCenter/";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"No";

Benefits from Every Class.

Action-Packed
Fitness and Exercise.

Action-packed games, activities, and
exercises give kids a great workout
from head to toe.

They get stronger, healthier and more fit within just a couple weeks. These fun exercises also help maintain a healthy weight!

The best part? The fitness is disguised as FUN! All your child will know is that they’re having a blast. But you and I know they’re also getting the exercise they need.


Self-Defense From Strangers, Bullies, and More.

Make no mistake about it: While our classes are tons of fun, we also cover the ""serious"" stuff too.

We teach kids about handling strangers... bullies... and more.

However, the first thing we teach is diplomacy. We give your child the tools they need to ""talk it out"" first. Violence is ALWAYS a last resort!



Powerful Character Development Breeds Discipline, Focus, and Respect.

For thousands of years, martial arts has been one of the best kept secrets for giving kids the skills they need for success in life.

Through inspiring stories and talks, as well as the process of learning the techniques, kids develop amazing traits, like:

Respect, discipline, focus, and goal setting.

I hope your child will never have to use their self-defense skills. But I guarantee these other skills will come in handy EVERY day for the rest of their life.


Fun, Fun, Fun!!!

While kids work hard and train hard in our classes...

... They also smile and laugh a LOT, too!

After all, these are kids we’re dealing with here! Our classes are a great place for kids to socialize, make friends, get support, and have a blast.

We view all of our members as part of the Elite BJJ team and encourage members to support each other both in class and outside the academy.

We constantly strive to provide the means of improvement for ourselves and our students, including seminars, special training and guest lectures.

BJJ is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting with the goal of gaining a dominant position from which to force an attacker to submit.  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training allows a smaller person using leverage and proper technique to defend themselves against a larger, stronger assailant.  It is for many of these reasons that Jiu-Jitsu proves to be an effective system for self-defense.

We are a proud member of Team Robson Moura.

The Roots of the “Vee Jitsu System of Systems” rests with the development of Modern Vee Jitsu. Modern Vee Jitsu is the classical style of Vee Jitsu that was taught exclusively by Supreme Grand Master Florendo Visitacion in the 1950’s.

The Modern Vee Jitsu fighting system has both an external and internal component. The external component conditions the body, develops physical power and takes the outward manifestations of strength. The internal component develops inward body functions (such as breathing), intuitive response, concentration and strength of will. In combination these two components form the yielding and flowing style of Modern Vee Jitsu. This fighting style is the progenitor of all the fighting systems developed by Supreme Grand Master Florendo Visitacion.

CW Post College Modern Vee Jitsu Club

In the spring of 1979 after over a decade of training with Supreme Grand Master Florendo Visitacion, Master Ken Brown requested permission to establish the C.W. Post Modern Vee Jitsu Club. That request was granted. Grand Master Florendo Visitacion, in conjunction with Master Ken Brown, began to formulate what is now known as the C.W. Post College Modern Vee Jitsu Club academic curriculum.

Professor Brown, under the guidance of Grand Master Vee, taught a comprehensive training program of lethal and non-lethal application of force. The course was taught 3 hours per day, five days a week for 4 years. This course included the following, Anatomical Resistance Maneuvers (A.R.M.). This aspect of the curriculum taught stabilization of the combatant with the use of wrist, arm, and shoulder control techniques. These techniques are non lethal but very effective in close quarters.

The second part of the course Digital Anatomic Manipulation (D.A.M.) involved controlling an adversary using pressure on finger joints. The strategy is unique for defense against larger opponents.

The final aspect of the course prior to graduation was Multiple Attack Defenses (M.A.D.). This was an advanced course that stressed the lethal use and application of Modern Vee Jitsu techniques, no holds barred. This course also included the use of all the Modern Vee Jitsu weapons disciplines, firearms, knife, and stick techniques.

Over the next Twenty-six years the Modern Vee Jitsu Club has expanded its teaching (under the direct tutelage of Supreme Grand Master Florendo Visitacion) to include several of the Vee Jitsu System of Systems martial arts, Vee Jitsu – Ju Jitsu, Vee Jitsu Te, and Vee Arnis Jitsu.

The Modern Vee Jitsu Membership has over 500 members and supporters in five different states. The members consist of medical professionals, law enforcement officials, attorneys, and teachers. Over the last two decades the Modern Vee Jitsu club has developed into a martial arts powerhouse and an intellectual learning center.

The president of the Modern Vee Jitsu Club is Dr. Robert Evans (Medical Doctor) Grand Master and the appointed Heir of “The Modern Vee Jitsu System”. Dr. Evans has proven to be a person of high integrity and vast knowledge.  The Modern Vee Jitsu philosophy has had a profound influence on his life.

Dr. Evans has over 30 years of exclusive Vee Jitsu training under the direct guidance of Supreme Grand Master Florendo Visitacion and Professor Ken Brown. He is an original member of the C.W. Post College Modern Vee Jitsu Club (1979). Dr. Evans (also known and Professor Evans) has played a major role in the development of the Modern Vee Jitsu System in its present scientific form. “The Modern Vee Jitsu Fighting System is geared towards the anatomical destruction and malfunction of the human anatomy”, says Dr. Evans, “We follow the true and unadulterated philosophy of the Supreme Grand master Florendo Visitacion.

We read what he has read, and we teach what he has taught. Variations to his teaching are not necessary: it will take another hundred years before we need to consider any changes. Modern Vee Jitsu is not a mixed martial art. It’s an intensely studied scientifically refined system.”

302 Jiu-Jitsu Philosophy

302 BJJ students and instructors follow 3 simple rules when encountering confrontation outside of the school’s safe training environment:

1st Choice is to avoid confrontation
2nd Choice is to use distance as your friend
3rd Choice is to use the learned techniques and feel comfortable in disadvantages positions, fighting off your back, fighting heavier opponents, and against stronger opponents

Happy kids are confident kids. Confident kids are safer kids. It seems simple when you think about it. However, when you’re looking for something to help your children become active, happy, self-confident, and better able to protect themselves; how many options are there that provide all of these benefits & more? The list is pretty small. That’s where Gracie Jiu Jitsu comes into the picture. Adapted by the Gracie Family in Brazil from its Japanese origins, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (or BJJ) is specifically designed to be practical, real world self-defense which helps to decrease the typical size/strength advantages that render many other martial arts ineffective.

Here at 302BJJ, we believe firmly that activity, fun, confidence, and safety can lay the foundation for a better life, and that Jiu Jitsu can provide them all. 302 Kids learn to be part of a team while standing on their own two feet. 302 Kids learn the confidence to protect themselves, both verbally and physically if necessary. 302 Kids learn to have fun, all while getting great exercise and training in a safe, practical martial art. 302 Kids are happy kids, happy kids are confident kids, & confident kids are safer kids. Come see for yourself why Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is one of the best investments you can make in your children’s present, and their future.

Youth 2 ( 5 - 7 years old)

20171016 Elevated marklikoskyphoto 41414The Youth 2 program is a fun and engaging approach to the martial arts and is great opportunity for students to learn fundamental techniques. In this program students will focus on awareness and avoidance techniques that can be used to prevent conflict. This will be supplemented with realistic self-defense and grappling skills. Complimented with traditional martial art values such as self-control, focus building, and respect, this program uses martial arts as a vehicle to empower students' lives. 


Youth 3 (8 - 12 years old)

20171016 Elevated marklikoskyphoto 39504There is a natural flow through our programs as students progress and move forward in the martial arts. With that in mind, the Youth 3 program picks up where the Youth 2 program leaves off. These students will refine their abilities and skills through live sparring, advanced self-protection drills, and greater resistance training all with an emphasis on safety. Because this program is a stepping stone to the adult program, the curriculum is the same.

We teach self defense techniques through a combination of skill building games, physical conditioning, and mental preparation. Our students not only improve their coordination, agility, and flexibility, they also develop important character traits and values. The confidence they obtain while learning BJJ ultimately helps them perform better in academics, become more outgoing in social settings, and set higher goals for their future. Most importantly, they have fun with great instructors and friends.
There are many martial arts to choose from, but in our opinion, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is the most effective and best suited for a child to learn. BJJ techniques are based on leverage and technique. It is a system designed to help a smaller person defeat a larger opponent, which makes it a perfect fit for kids. Our youth students learn how to stay calm in hostile situations. We first teach them to avoid a confrontation if at all possible. But if it isn't, they will know how to engage an opponent, control the situation, and create an opportunity to end a fight without permanent damage to themselves or their opponent. Keeping hold of an aggressor and making them give up is much more humane than giving them a black eye, while potentially hurting your hand in the process.

I was born in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil on January 19, 1959. I started training in Rio De Janeiro in 1977 at the age of 18 under Rolls Gracie and continued to train with him until Rolls died in 1982 in a hang-gliding accident. After Rolls passing, I continued my training under Rolls’s brother, Rickson Gracie. After 7 years of practicing BJJ I was awarded the black belt in 1984 by Rickson Gracie together with Grand Master Helio Gracie. Currently I am a 7th degree Coral Belt (Black and Red belt) in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I received my Coral belt in 2010 by Grand Master Carlos Robson Gracie, Red Belt 9th Degree (President of the Jiu-Jitsu Federation of Rio de Janeiro). In 1999, then a 6th degree black belt, I was asked to move from Brazil to come to the United States to teach at Rickson Gracie’s Academy in Los Angeles. After teaching there for almost 8 years, in 2007, I opened my own Academy “Jacksonville Gracie Jiu Jitsu” in Jacksonville FL, where I currently reside.
As a competitor I have won the Rio de Janeiro championships several times and in 1998 was the Brazilian National Champion in the heavy weight senior division and open. In 2002 I took 3rd place in Masters and Seniors International. I have also won the Pan American Champion super heavy weight senior division and open in 2000, 2003, and 2004.
During my teaching career I have been involved with introducing BJJ techniques into combative training in the military and with law-enforcement in the United States as well as Europe. I am a certified Army Combative instructor and have initiated the development of an on-going Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu based Combative training program inside the US Navy SEALS compound in Dam Neck, Virginia Beach, VA. In 2010, in preparation for their deployment to Afghanistan, the 3rd Battalion 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) invited me to conduct a five month long training program at Camp Blanding. In addition to teaching BJJ in the army, I also provide BJJ instruction to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office (JSO).
In 2006, I released two instructional DVDs featuring Closed Guard Attacks, as well as techniques for progressing from White to Blue Belt. I have also founded the BJJ GRAND PRIX (www.bjjgrandprix.com) website since 2008 and in conjunction with the Florida National Guard started conducting two tournaments every year at the National Guard Armory in Jacksonville, FL, to promote BJJ in the NE Florida area. One in the spring called the JAX BJJ OPEN, and one in the fall called the SUNSHINE STATE BJJ OPEN.

Jacksonville Gracie Jiu Jitsu is led by Luiz Palhares who is a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitor and instructor. Palhares was presented his 7th degree black and red belt by the President of the Jiu-Jitsu Federation of Rio de Janeiro, Carlos Robson Gracie, in 2010. Palhares spent over 23 years being trained directly by the Gracie family, first under Rolls Gracie until his tragic Hang Gliding accident, then later under Rickson Gracie. He was awarded his black belt in 1984 by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu co-founder Helio Gracie and Rickson Gracie.

During his lifetime Palhares has also accumulated a number of world-class competitive victories. Beginning in 1998, he won both senior heavy weight and open divisions of the Brazilian National Jiu-Jitsu Championships. Later, in 2000, 2003, and 2004, again in both the senior heavy weight and open divisions, he took 1st place at the Pan-American Championship. In 2002, Palhares also claimed 3rd place at the Masters and Seniors International championship.

As an instructor Palhares has taught throughout the US and Europe. He teaches seminars and conducts private lessons around the globe. As a certified Army Combatives instructor he developed a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Combatives program for the US Navy SEALs at Dam Neck, Virginia. At Camp Blanding, Florida in 2010, Palhares taught a five month long Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program for the 3rd Battalion 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) prior to their deployment to Afghanistan. He has taught Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu seminars for the US Marines in Tennessee and at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Palhares also enjoys a long standing relationship with the Jacksonville Florida Sheriff's Office (JSO) to provide instruction.

Our names are Michael and David Zolondek, and we have opened Jacksonville’s only Jiu Jitsu gym focusing almost exclusively on No-Gi training. But we hope that after you visit us you will realize that this is not all that sets us apart. My brother and I were lucky enough to inherit a unique style of training from our teacher in Scotland, William Watson, who spends virtually all his time figuring out ways of getting students great at No-Gi Jiu Jitsu in the shortest period of time possible. We are now bringing this innovative style of teaching to Jacksonville, FL, and we are confident that the results will be much the same: you will get VERY good VERY quickly…and you will have loads of fun doing it!

We offer morning and evening classes, and lots of open mat time! But much more importantly, we offer extremely laid-back, friendly, and fun classes, taught by instructors who aim to foster a respectful and generous environment in which to train, with no gym politics and no pressure to compete.

So come visit us in North Jacksonville, sign up for our 6-class/3-week trial free trial, and discover how fast you can improve all while having a great time and making lots of good friends! We look forward to training with you!

The Garage:

The name of our gym, “The Garage”, is very meaningful to my brother and me. We have been working out and training in fight sports for virtually all of our lives. The most fun and productive training we’ve had has been in our garage, which we converted into our personal training area. We had heavy bags, speed bags, double-end bags, an area for benching, squats, and free-weights, and, of course, mat space. Unfortunately, when Mike went away to pursue his PhD, our garage became less of a regular training area and more of…well…a garage. But now that we have been given the opportunity to open up a training space to the public, we could think of nothing better than to name it after the place where all of our great training memories were made. We hope that when you visit us at The Garage, we will be able to give you the same great training experiences that we’ve been privileged to have.";"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/448279545498456064/gvVVIA4g_400x400.png";"http://www.thegaragenogi.com/2014/06/01/kids-no-gi-jiu-jitsu-classes-start-june-2nd-at-6pm/";"We’re pleased to offer No-Gi Jiu Jitsu and Takedowns classes for kids!

Karate Classes for Beginners and Kids Karate Classes in Davie, FL.

BEGINNERS KARATE CLASSES AND KIDS KARATE CLASSES:  The Beginner’s Classes are designed to introduce and nurture the “new” student in the fundamentals of Martial Arts in general and American Kenpo Karate in specific.  The focus is on building solid basic skills.  The classes are designed to develop the various kinds of kicks, punches, and stances as well as the basics to movement and introduce the student to the principles that American Kenpo Karate is known for throughout the world.  In kicking, we learn front kicks, side kicks, back kicks, roundhouse kicks.  In punches, we learn front hand, rear hand, straight punches, cross over punches, ridge hands and more.  We also learn the elementary forms and technics of American Kenpo Karate. The first three belt groups (White, Yellow, and Orange belts) are considered the beginner’s ranks.  During the beginner’s phase of their training students can participate in the beginner’ sparring classes which are made up of two parts.  The first stage is what we call “sparring drills” where the student learns basic sparring skills in preparation for the second level of sparring.  The second stage is actual sparring where the student can safely experience a “sparring match” with other students of equal skill and experience.  

Typically new students are beginners for about nine months. We also begin the process of developing the life skills that are so important in character development in children and Teens. We incorporate the process of developing self-confidence, respect for self and others, the importance of integrity in all we do, why its important to be modest, the importance of courtesy, how self-control helps us become our best as well as many other life skills. Beginners typically begin by coming in and trying an introductory lesson which helps us evaluate which class is best suited for the student’s developmental stage. Age has a lot to do with developmental skill development of fine and gross motor skills, attention span, left/right brain transition and other skill levels. We offer four curriculum tracts to best suit each student’s individual needs. Little Eagles, Youth, Teen and Adult curriculum paths help students get the most from their training. After in introductory class for those who are NOT sure about making a commitment we offer our Introductory Program which is a one week (typically two to three classes) program. For those who know our center is a good choice for them we ask they enroll in our beginner’s program which is a six-month program of two to three classes per week.

Much can be learned, relearned, or remembered from teaching children. They are as much our teachers as we are theirs. If you free yourself of your own indoctrination, you will quickly realize that their state of being is one of fluid, natural, and receptive acceptance of the universe. The common martial art's philosophy of fluid yielding and movement is living and well represented in children already. As guides we need only to protect and preserve this wellspring and assist them in transferring it smoothly into adulthood. If done correctly, they will mature with the courage and responsibility to successfully pass along what they themselves never lost; their sense of adventure, wonder, and the joy to explore beyond the limits of current modalities of thought.

  
“Play is the only way the highest intelligence of humankind can unfold.”- Joseph Chilton Pearce
Children have a natural confidence from the moment they are born. They explore, improvise, and innovate with anything at their disposal. Unfortunately in many cases, this source of light is conditioned erroneously, and eventually they cease to be the gifted learners they were born to be.
""Work is seen as play and discipline is simply the rules of the game."" 

At ODMA…
1. We do not train children, we assist them to develop to their full potential.
2. We do not condition them to respond predictably through rote technique, we provide the conditions for them to evolve and create dynamic means by which to achieve success.
3. We do not use a win or lose paradigm. We use incremental and progressively increasing challenges in complexity, intensity, and unpredictability to provide the child with positive feedback and ""errorless learning.""
4. We are not there to think for them. We are there to reinforce an environment conducive to the stability and maintenance of independence, freedom, and creativity.

“The amazing martial arts classes not only teach kids self-defense, but gives them the tools they need for success in life!”
From improved focus, to goal setting, self-discipline and self-respect – kids emerge from this program changed for the better. And their parents couldn’t be happier.

Vagner Rocha Martial Arts has classes specifically designed for children and teens (ages 4-15). Our martial arts classes are divided by age and experience. Classes include traditional Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and realistic self-defense techniques including stand up and ground techniques, submissions, reversals, restraint and escapes. We use structured drills to refine motor skills and to allow children to progress throughout our martial arts program.
The Vagner Rocha Martial Arts school is filled with high energy, fun classes designed to keep our students engaged and motivated. Parents will watch their children develop self-defense skills, athletic abilities, and physical fitness over the course of their martial arts training.

Leadership Skills
Every parent wants to instill confidence in their child in order to handle peer pressure in a positive way. Bullies are more likely to pick on kids with less confidence, which only comes from practice and experience.

The rewarding experience provided by Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, systematically builds confidence in kids of all ages. Our Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Program teaches students how to become role models among their friends, promoting the practice of leadership and exercising the proper life skills to their full potential! Confidence, teamwork and public speaking are just some of the leadership and life skills we teach and practice.

Our students learn that they are rewarded for the effort they put into tasks, as well as learning how to emotionally handle situations which don’t go as planned.

Improve Physical Fitness and Condition
Our kids martial arts classes are filled with drills to build stamina, strength and speed. They assist students to improve their coordination, balance and endurance, which will give them an edge in other sports and activities, besides Jiu-Jitsu.

Self-Defense Skills
Our curriculum includes grappling training, to teach and show students a realistic approach towards self-defense. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a grappling-based martial art like no other. Its focus is on the skill of controlling a resisting opponent in ways that force him to submit.

Personalized Attention
Our instructors always make sure that students are learning techniques properly, correcting them and improving skills to further their progress. We want to see our students improve and excel and that’s why we give our students the individual attention they deserve. Our qualified instructors use a sensitive approach to the issues that children in general face in today’s society, teaching them safety and awareness.";"https://www.vagnerrochamartialarts.com/self-defense-classes-women";"Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Boxing – combined these two classes are the perfect solution for any women looking to learn or improve their ability to defend themselves from anyone, in any situation.

Nothing is more terrifying for a woman than being attacked and not knowing her options for survival. At Vagner Rocha Martial Arts, our mission is not only to instruct women of all ages to be aware of dangerous situations, but also provide our students with practical self-defense techniques, proven to be effective in real world-situations. Our women’s self-defense curriculum is based in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, which is largely considered to be the best and most viable form of self-defense available. With Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at its core, our women’s program is focused on the unique dangers and challenges faced by women today, and provides our members with the skills and confidence that is necessary to avoid potential harm, as well as to protect themselves against an aggressor.

Our Women’s Self Defense program aims to teach women how to defend themselves from a different perspective. Women will learn how to defend themselves standing up (which is usually how an attack starts), and they also learn how to defend themselves on the ground (which is usually where an attack ends).

Even our head instructor, black belt Vagner Rocha, places his trust in the effectiveness of our women’s self-defense program and ensures that both his wife and daughter are trained in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Boxing self-defense for their own personal safety. As such, we encourage women of all ages to try our classes. We understand that women are often hesitant to try self-defense classes for several different reasons; however, we guarantee you will feel comfortable from the moment you walk into our school. Our staff will guide and assist you with all attention you deserve!

"Valente Brothers Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Pembroke Pines";"http://www.graciemiami.com/";" +1 305-354-2060";"16360 26th Avenue";"North Miami Beach";"FL ";33160;;"United States";"Over the last 50 years, three generations of the Valente family have learned Jiu-Jitsu directly from Grand Master Helio Gracie. Pedro Valente Sr. started learning judo at the age of nine. Pedro’s dad Syllo Valente, was an admirer of Helio Gracie and took Pedro, who was 12 at the time, to watch the world title fight between Helio and Kimura. The challenge took place at Maracana Stadium that seats over 100,000 spectators. Even though the heavier Kimura won, they were very impressed with Helio’s amazing technique and decided to enroll at the original Gracie Academy in Rio de Janeiro.

The late Dr. Syllo Valente was a naturalist and a homeopathic doctor. Like many Brazilians, he was impressed with Grand Master Helio’s great feats and found in Jiu-Jitsu an ideal complement to his life and the education of his son, Pedro.

Pedro Sr. became one of the Gracie Academy’s top students and went on to participate in several high profile challenge matches including a fight in Maracanãzinho stadium in front of 20 thousand people.

As a medical student, in the early 60’s, Pedro Sr. met one of Brazil’s most prominent plastic surgeons at the Gracie Academy. Training partners on the mat both developed a great friendship. This connection contributed greatly to the rapid success he achieved as a surgeon. In the early 80’s the New York Times recognized him as one of the world’s top 5 plastic surgeons. An accomplished physician, Dr. Valente became in two occasions Rio de Janeiro’s Secretary of Health and in one other opportunity Secretary of Transportation. Sports are also an important part of his life, in particular, Equestrian Show Jumping and Football (Soccer). He was Vasco da Gama’s Vice President and Chief Doctor. Vasco is one of the world’s most recognized Soccer teams.

The Valente Brothers were born into the Jiu-Jitsu tradition. Pedro, Gui and Joaquim began learning Jiu-Jitsu from their father as soon as they learned how to walk. At the tender age of two, Pedro, Gui and Joaquim were already taking private lessons from Grandmaster Helio Gracie. Growing up, the Valente brothers trained daily at the original Gracie Academy in Rio de Janeiro under Helio, Royler, and Rolker Gracie. Throughout their training they had the privilege to learn from all the Gracie Brothers: Rorion, Relson, Rickson, Rolker, Royler, Royce, and Robin.

At the age of 18, Pedro decided to move to the United States in order to attend the University of Miami School of Business Administration. In order to prepare for the challenges of moving to a foreign country and living alone, Dr. Valente sent Pedro to spend one month at Grandmaster Helio’s ranch in Itaipava. During this time Pedro was carefully prepared not only to live alone in America, but also to introduce the art of Jiu-Jitsu In Miami. In 1993, Pedro received his Instructor Certification from the Gracie Academy, and started teaching classes in Miami. Although many years would pass before the name Valente Brothers would be used, this is now regarded as the founding of Valente Brothers in Miami, exactly 40 years after the Valente family was first introduced to Jiu-Jitsu at the Gracie Academy in Rio de Janeiro. During his college years, Pedro continued his training by constantly traveling to the Gracie Academy in Rio de Janeiro. In 1995, with the instrumental assistance of Rorion and Royce Gracie, Pedro founded a Jiu-Jitsu club at the University of Miami where he taught several students and faculty members.

During this time, Pedro continued to teach private and group classes through out the state of Florida and counted with the valuable contributions of fellow University of Miami classmate Humberto Lopez. In 1998, with the help of long time friend and student James Robertson, Pedro inaugurated his first full time academy in Sunny Isles, Florida.

In 1999, Gui also moved to South Florida to attend Barry University and help his brother with the Academy. The addition of Gui Valente to the school was instrumental in the massive growth that our academy would experience in the years to come. This was due to the fact that he spent countless hours on and off the mat with Grandmaster Helio. Most of his vacations were spent at Grandmaster Helio’s ranch in the mountains of Rio as he was being groomed to assist Pedro in Miami. By this time Gracie Miami, now known as Valente Brothers was internationally recognized as the home of the genuine Jiu-Jitsu of Hélio Gracie in Florida.

The youngest of the Valente Brothers, Joaquim, moved to Miami in 2007 to study criminology at Barry University. He quickly impressed everyone through his unique technique, outstanding teaching skills and remarkable charisma. Joaquim, like his brothers, had Grand Master Helio as his main teacher and trained weekly with the Grand Master. Joaquim was also very fortunate to spend many vacations and long weekends living with Grand Master Helio in his ranch. Joaquim played a pivotal role in the development of our curriculums as he was still living in Brazil and could work with Grand Master Helio directly and provide Pedro and Gui with valuable information. 

In 1999, Pedro successfully completed the Jiu-Jitsu Professor’s course and received his diploma and title of Jiu-Jitsu Professor. In 2001 Gui was also awarded the coveted Professor’s Diploma. In 2007 Joaquim recieved the Professors' Diploma by Grand Master Helio Gracie. This was a great accomplishment and honor in light of the fact that in 75 years only 27 people received this diploma from Grand Master Helio Gracie.

The Valente Brothers specialize in the genuine Helio Gracie Self-Defense System, which has been proven to be extremely effective not only for the general public, but also for police and military officials.In addition to their Jiu-Jitsu skills, Pedro holds a Masters Degree in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Miami and Gui holds a Master of Science in Sport Management from Barry University’s School of Human Performance and Leisure Sciences. Joaquim Valente holds a degree in criminology from Barry University.";"http://www.katanajiujitsu.com/assets/images/valente-brothers2-1400x1400.jpg";"https://www.graciemiami.com/youth-program/";"BUILDING ROCK SOLID KIDS
Every day in the United States, an estimated 150,000 kids miss school due to fear or intimidation of bullies. In fact, many believe that fear of bullying may be the leading cause of low self-confidence in children. Worse, statistics suggest that less than 15% of kids actually report acts of bullying. We know that most bullies are insecure and seek self-esteem normally by harassing smaller or weaker children. These negative experiences often create psychological trauma that might last a lifetime.
The Valente Brothers Youth Program focuses on the physical, emotional and mental well being, as well as the education of our children. It is “Education for Life.” Firstly, we provide our young students with the most powerful defensive skills so they will be ready to stand up against bullies. In addition, we assist our students with the development of characteristics and skills they will need in order to live a happy and balanced life.  Our young pupils develop confidence, discipline, courage, responsibility, and leadership among other important values. We promote non-violent resolutions to conflict.
The Valente Brothers Youth Program focuses a great deal of attention to the development of self-esteem. A good self-image is the basis of a well functioning, happy and successful child.
Our curriculum integrates physical education and self-defense techniques with conditioning and skill oriented games aimed at improving your child’s coordination, motor skills, agility and flexibility. Every instructor receives training in our unique teaching methodology, enabling them to deliver learning through dynamic interaction with the children, using a variety of approaches that meet the various learning types of individual children, whether visual, kinesthetic or auditory. To learn more about our school set up a free introductory class.


Little Champs TM (3-5)
The Little Champs class focuses primarily on building the winning attributes needed for learning and productive living such as discipline, courtesy, confidence, character, focus, concentration, and teamwork. In addition, we focus on building basic athletic skills like strength, flexibility, and coordination. The Little Champs classes are extremely entertaining and allow children to develop useful defensive skills in a recreational way.  Our professors are trained to always treat the children in a positive manner looking to constantly raise their self-confidence.


Juniors (6-7),  Juniors 1 (8-10), Juniors 2 (11-16)  
At Valente Brothers Jiu-Jitsu, we employ a diverse teaching methodology within different fields of study aimed not only at providing practical self-defense knowledge, but also a holistic personal development. Through our unique pedagogy, we strive to help our young students develop their personalities as empowered members of their communities. Mutual respect and cooperation are encouraged, as well as socializing, problem solving and, of course, fun. We work hard to ensure that our young students stay away from all the negative habits that are so common with many teenagers. The instructors at Valente Brothers serve as powerful role models of positive and healthy behavior both on and off the mat.";"https://www.graciemiami.com/womens-program/";"The Valente Brothers Womens’ program was specifically designed to prepare women for real life threatening situations. Our Self Defense techniques provide the knowledge and skills for any woman to escape from her attacker, whether she is on her feet or on the ground. This course is unique because it does not rely exclusively on punching and kicking, as do many other forms of martial arts.

Punching and kicking do not represent an effective strategy against an assailant who is bigger, stronger and capable of hitting back. In addition, they are useless on the ground, which is where a rapist/attacker is most likely to assault a woman.

In addition to empowering women through the most effective self-defense techniques, the regular practice of Jiu-Jitsu represents one of the most complete forms of exercise. Students quickly notice an increase in flexibility, muscle strength, endurance and general well being.";"N/A";"N/A";"https://www.graciemiami.com/northmiamibeach/";"Monday: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM

ABOUT OUR LOGO

American Tigers has chosen to use the Tiger as its symbol and logo, because it’s such a rich part of the Korean folk tale and history.

At present South Koreans call the peninsula Hanguk, while North Koreans call the peninsula Choson. South Korea divides itself politically into nine provinces and six special cities. North Korea divides itself politically into nine provinces and three special cities. The Korean peninsula is about 600 miles long, but at its shortest width (near the DMZ), it is only 120 miles from coast to coast. Many South Koreans, especially younger ones, describe their peninsula as “tiger-shaped.” The tiger is a traditional symbol that drives away misfortune, but it also represents the urban and aggressively successful modern South Korean economy.

The embroidered breast patch on the court attire of military officials includes tigers and leopards, both symbols of valor and courage.

Tae Kwon Do is the national sport of Korea, and the Tiger is the national animal of Korea.  Along with that we chose to use the stars and the color scheme of our nations red, white and blue to create our logo.  

Thinking through our logo was important to us, because it needed to symbolize unity of our nations coming together within this discipline called Tae Kwon Do.  We wanted our logo to represent strength, dignity and character.  The world has become a global melting pot, and hence it has the fortune of collaborating traditions, disciplines and history that represents this sport, as we see it.

"5th St. Gym";"http://5thstgym.com/";" +1 305-763-8110";"1434 Alton Rd";"Miami Beach";"FL";33139;"2/5 Stars";"United States";"The 5th St. Gym got its start in 1950 when Chris Dundee began promoting big time boxing in Miami Beach. It quickly became the celebrated University of Boxing, overseen by Chris, the “Wizard of Oz”, and his brother Angelo, the “Prince of Oz”. The gym was also a magnet for a wide range of international celebrities including Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Jackie Gleason, Malcolm X, The Beatles, Sean Connery, Frank Sinatra, Sylvester Stallone, and a myriad of others who were absorbed into the gym’s legendary mystique. Boxing people the world over sent their fighters to be trained at the 5th St. gym. Every possible thing that could be taught about this grim profession of boxing was taught by the Wizard. It originally lasted around four decades and created countless world champions, such as Carmen Basilio, Willie Pastrano and the greatest of them all, Cassius Clay-who then became the ubiquitous Muhammad Ali. He still remains the shining accomplishment of Oz (5th St. Gym). 
It helped shape the history of Miami Beach. It is synonymous with the history of Miami Beach for what it was and has become once again. The gym became a tourist attraction in the decayed streets as the money had moved north the Fountain Bleu and Eden Roc. The biggest names and fighters paraded through this magical gym known as 5th St Gym; Ali, Basilio, Griffilth, Arche Moore, Willie Pep, Sonny Liston, Roberto Duran. The list is infinite. As shabby and unkempt the area was, the gym simply belonged.
It had taken many years, but once again the gym came alive in 2009. The Wizard was gone. The original concrete was gone. Ali and Pacheco had aged along with the Prince. However, the magic of 5th St. Gym was reborn and the love of boxing was back. The rebirth of the 5th St. Gym has continued to keep its spirit alive.

Tom Tsatas and Dino Spencer  dusted off Oz; and with the guidance and blessing of Angelo the gym once again re-opened in its original location at 5th and Washington.

Dino Spencer, Angelo Dundee’s student and protégé is the direct lineage for the gym. Dino, who has lived his life in the gym and also trained under current world renowned trainer Freddy Roach, is now here to condition, work corners, and teach a new crop and changed generation the art of conditioning, boxing and a new found sport of MMA to youth, women and new-comers. Tom Tsatas, who coincidentally shares the same birthday with Muhammad Ali (Jan 17th), has used his passion for boxing to take on the insurmountable task of reviving the marvel that is the 5th St. Gym-thus, sustaining the legacy of its predecessor. Although Cassisus Clay or The Wizard Chris Dundee can never be replaced, for there can only ever be one of each, the world is sure to see a new line of accomplished fighters emerge from the 5th St. Gym. This duo has used the surreal energy of the legends who had trained here to uphold the memory of some of the greatest individuals in boxing history. Sadly Angelo passed away in February of 2012 but his spirit truly lives on. 

In 2013 the 5th St. Gym finally moved from the original location at 5th & Washington. It was there on and off for 63 years. CVS would take over and force the gym to move to a new location at 1434 Alton Rd. It has been a fresh new start but the gym has kept the heart and soul of its core between the new walls on Alton. It is not the location that matters but the soul of the gym. 

The gym today is training an array of talent. Everyone from Victoria Secrets supermodel Adriana Lima to Bernard Hopkins and Grammy winner Cedric Gervais can be seen there on a regular basis.  Fres Oquendo who fought recently for the WBA Championship and Bilal Laggoune who won the EBU Cruiserweight Championship make 5th St. Gym their home when in training camp. Mostly however, the locals who live and work in the area have made 5th St. Gym their second home. Moms, doctors, models, and dads and their kids alike are keeping the  5th St. Gym alive and well . We are truly excited and looking forward to even better times in the future. Thank you and remember. “It don’t cost nuthin to be nice!”-Angelo Dundee";"http://www.5thstgym.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/logo-bwr.png";"N/A";"N/A";"http://www.5thstgym.com/womens-classes/";"
Conditioning

All of our classes are more like semi-privates. Unlike most gyms, 5th St. Gym’s classes are called Semi-privates because class size is usually limited to no more that 8-10 people, usually even less than that. This has been specifically created for those individuals who want the personal one on one touch in a team environment and who also are able to fit the exclusivity into their budget.

Strength and Conditioning are specific training, resistance training and high-intensity cardio. It is designed to be easy to follow and target strength building as well as muscular endurance. The time between exercises in circuit training is short, often with rapid movement to the next exercise.

First, the system is designed for a shorter learning curve. It gives the practitioner less time before they should be able to actively defend themselves. It concentrates on the practical aspects of martial arts that lend themselves to self-defense.

This leads to the second way it is different.
It is a flexible system.

The system itself is a modern system that is still growing, and as such is capable of change. The traditional aspects of martial arts are still present and honored as such, but Atemi ryu Jujutsu is not locked into them.

The third aspect that is different is the instructors.
Doctor Chenique has imbued his instructors with the unusual ability to think about situations in innovative ways. They can apply techniques they already know in new situations, or in new applications. All of this combines to create a system.

History of Atemi-Ryu Ju-Jitsu
Jujutsu is a Japanese martial art which practices armed and unarmed combat techniques. It can also be spelled “jujitsu” or “jiujitsu” as older translations were not as established as they are today. It is sometimes called Japanese jujutsu to distinguish it from one of its derivatives: Brazilian jujutsu. Jujutsu was originally one aspect of martial arts used by the samurai of medieval Japan. The general concept of Jujutsu covers any way that the human body can be used as a weapon. Each family, or clan, had a particularstyle of unarmed combat in which they would train. This naturally led to a wide variety of arts called “jujutsu” that involve different amounts of striking, throwing, locking, and close quarters ground fighting. During the latter part of the 1800s, there was a great proliferation in the number and styles of martial arts in Japan, including jujutsu. As such diversification took place, jujutsu gave rise to such martial arts such as Judo, Aikido. The study of jujutsu was largely closed to Westerners until after WWII.

Professor Florendo Visatacion (1909 – January 4, 1999), or as he is also known Professor Vee, was born in Ilocos Norte in the Philippines. Around age 13, Professor Vee started to learn Arnis, a Filipino form of martial stick/knife fighting. At age 16, he and his family moved to Hawaii where he continued his martial studies. In 1928, he moved to Stockton, California, where he continued to learn Filipino martial arts from any source that was available. However, it wasn’t until his time in the U.S. Army during WWII that his martial arts journey became truly inspired. After reading the Army officer’s hand-to-hand manual that claimed to be a combination of techniques from various sources, Professor Vee traveled and studied many different arts for the purposes of understanding their principles and when to apply them effectively. He started his martial arts instruction career, which lasted for over three decades, in the mid-1950s in New York. One of the men he taught was Professor Moses Powell. In 1955, Professor Vee introduced Vee-Jutsu, which as he continued to study more, would undergo various  modifications and changes. In 1965, he updated and improved the art and introduced Vee-Jutsu ’65. In 1971, Professor Vee presented another update to his system, now called Vee-Jitsu ryu Jiujutsu. In 1983, he removed the katas from Kempo in favor of the Arnis katas, and as such, renamed the system Vee-ArnisJutsu.

Professor Moses Powell (January 13, 1941 – January 22, 2005) was born in Norfolk, Virginia. His martial arts training included boxing, Vee-Jitsu Te, Vee Jutsu ryu, Shorin ryu Karate, and Tomini Aikido among other arts. In 1959 Professor Powell combined his 45 years of martial arts experience and founded Sanuces ryu Jujutsu. He credits Professor Vee with giving him the knowledge and confidence to become a great martial artist.

Doctor Philip Chenique first entered to the world of martial arts at the age of seven, beginning with the study of Judo at the Y.M.C.A. in New York. He also undertook the study of Karate and Kenjutsu. By age 13, Dr. Chenique was studying Take-NoUchi Kogen-Ryu Atemi Jujitsu with Sensei Richard Adams. At age 20, he studied Shotokan Karate under the guidance of Shihan Barry Deutsch. Dr. Chenique soon became a student of Professor Moses Powell, and Dr. Powell's teacher, Master Florendo Vistacion, as well as many other Grandmasters. In 1975, after attaining the rank of Shihan, Grandmaster Chenique established his form of Jujitsu, which he christened Atemi-Ryu Jujitsu.

Teaching Philosophy

Martial arts have evolved rapidly in recent years. Many people are getting involved in this kind of training and more training is becoming available. We must often balance opposing forces when it comes to student development.

1. Safety – Our primary concern is student safety. While we understand that real growth comes when one is outside the comfort zone, it’s more important to be consistent in training and to do that one must be healthy and injury free.

2. Belts and Grading – we evaluate our students and issue belts and certificates.

3.

4. Teamwork and Respect – an atmosphere of teamwork and mutual respect among students is expected. Higher ranked students are expected to facilitate lower ranked students. It is expected that the student will also take the attitude of teamwork and respect out into the world as well. The teacher is the facilitator and guide for students and recognizes that each student must be his own teacher in the end.

5. Central Question – How can I develop myself to the best of my abilities and fulfill my potential as a human being?

Kid's Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Submission Wrestling
Jiu-jitsu is an art with a long and rich history, from its earliest mentions in the Samurai era, to its development as a unique and distinct art of grappling-oriented techniques. This history progresses further with the Judo distillation under Jigoro Kano, and yet still further by the Brazilian Jiu-jitsu or Gracie Jiu-jitsu revolution of the modern age.The arena of MMA or the Mixed Martial Arts, has demonstrated clearly the importance of an integrated approach to one's Martial Arts training regimen. The Brazilian Top Team, and its U.S. counterpart, American Top Team, were the first Brazilian-based Jiu-jitsu fighters to truly complete their technique by seeking to join forces with experts in boxing and wrestling in order to unify the seemingly disparate combative methods.The fact that these sorts of maneuvers do not rely on strength and size but rather technique and leverage makes Brazilian Jiu-jitsu a viable self-defense system for a child and not yet an adult. With the fitness and even obesity issues that are so common in this country today, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Submission Wrestling stands as an excellent exercise choice for today's child.

In times past, the Martial Arts were a thing usually generalized as a male-oriented pursuit. And while that was not truly the case, these arts were definitely a predominantly male activity.
Beginning in the 1980's, the Martial Arts industry became modernized, and at the same time a great number of Martial Arts gyms and schools began to increase their level of professionalism to match their already high level of technical quality. The immediate result was that schools around the country and elsewhere saw an explosive increase of women among their ranks. Since then, many Martial Arts programs have both men and women in equal numbers, and there are many cases where women are dominant gender. The need of some variety of self-defense training for today's woman is a basic and apparent facet of martial culture, less obvious may be the fitness and wellness capacity of these arts. The Martial Arts are also a fascinating and profound realm of human possibility, empowering a person to ascend beyond ordinary human limitation.

Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Submission Wrestling
For a woman who isn't afraid to ""get her hands dirty"", so to speak, grappling is a fascinating and effective method of achieving dominance over a person. The very nature of takedowns, the establishing of dominant positions and the application of techniques of submission embody control and power. Brazilian Jiu-jitsu has a compelling history surrounding a certain Helio Gracie, who due to being a sickly young man, was unable to execute many existing Jiu-jitsu techniques due to their reliance on a certain degree of raw strength. His reformation and distillation of this body of knowledge led to the evolution of the Brazilian style of Jiu-jitsu, a method which can be employed effectively against a large and strong attacker regardless of one's size and strength. Chokes, joint locks, and positions of control native to Jiu-jitsu are combined with techniques from Wrestling, Judo, and other grappling methods to achieve a complete and unparalleled system of self-defense. Stop by our gym if you are interested in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu in Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, Lighthouse Point, or Deerfield Beach.

Capoeira
While many associate the Martial Arts with their combat-components, there is much in the way of artistic beauty and expression to be found in varying degrees throughout the martial world. Perhaps the most beautiful and dynamic of these arts comes to us from the beaches of Brazil. Capoeira has a rich history, from its roots in Africa to its development in Brazil, and has come to dazzle the entire physical-culture world with its spectacular display of fighting movements, acrobatics, and dance. This awesome spectacle is complimented by the native sounds of Brazil, utilizing both native Brazilian instrumentalism as well as traditional vocal accompaniments. Capoeira is a unique voyage into the culture of Brazil as well as a fun and expressive physical workout. Many women find it's gracefulness and rhythmic orientation to be the perfect outlet for martial expression and practice. Stop by our gym if you are interested in Capoeira in Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, Lighthouse Point, or Deerfield Beach.

Cardio Kickboxing

Stop by our gym if you are interested in Cardio Kickboxing in Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, Lighthouse Point, or Deerfield Beach.

MMA Women
Fighting is one of the most basic and primal of all human actions. From the primeval times where humanity defended itself from the beasts of the earth, as well as one another; fighting is ever-present. Today's contemporary Martial Arts landscape abounds with differing forms of martial training. Some of these are less combative, others more so. The ferocity and fighting skill that we see in professional MMA competition is tremendous, among both men and women. This hybrid fighting-style utilizes techniques from various disciplines of combat sports and arts, to achieve a liberated and dynamic Martial Art, second to none in effectiveness. If you are woman or teenager who is interested in MMA fighting, participation in actual MMA training will bring you to a higher level of appreciation and enjoyment for this strong and hard-hitting combat-sport. MMA will transform your entire being into a lean and lethal weapon of grace and destructive-ability. Stop by our gym if you are interested in Mixed Martial Arts in Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, Lighthouse Point, or Deerfield Beach.

Taekwondo
Combining self-defense, exercise, and Eastern philosophy in an expressive physical art is what Taekwondo does, in a very unique and beautiful way.This Korean-based Martial Art emphasizes kicking techniques as its weapon of choice. The theoretical basis of Taekwondo recognizes the legs as being the stronger of the two pairs of extremities; at the same time, the legs are also he longer range weapon in relation to the arms.These two points make kicking techniques and Taekwondo an excellent choice for a woman interested in martial training. By utilizing the legs, you are able to on the one hand generate a great deal of power, and on the other remain at some distance from your opponent and their punches and wrestling.
Taekwondo is an intense type of workout, an instruction in combative theory and methodology, as well as a voyage into the philosophy and culture of the east. Increased self-confidence, strength, fitness, and self-discipline are some of its benefits. Stop by our gym if you are interested in Taekwondo in Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, Lighthouse Point, or Deerfield Beach.

Yoga
The benefits of Yoga are manifold, as well as profound. This ancient mind-body system of wellness and enlightenment has its origins in the traditions of India, and has since that time spread across the globe, enriching the lives of countless devotees. Physically speaking, Yoga is well-known for producing a lean, toned appearance, favored by the majority of today's women as opposed to the sort of development associated with body-building. The importance of maintaining a full-range of motion in regards to the limbs and torso, throughout a person's life, is a given.

WHY DO MOST OF US FAIL TO GET FIT?
BECAUSE DIETS & GYMS SUCK!

Sorry if I’m being too bold… but I get frustrated thinking about all my Weston Boot camp ladies who used to be stuck in the pit of hopelessness and despair that diets and gyms can create for women desperately trying to lose weight. Let’s start with how I feel about diets…
A Better Way To Replace Diets & Gyms

its no secret. Gyms and diets set us up for failure They always have.

In fact, most gym workouts rarely workout. There are 3 reasons why:

    They're crowded, boring, tedious and often confusing.
    It's hard to stay motivated month after month when you are on your own.
    Most relevant of all, if you don't know what you're doing you're likely to fail.

To get fit, you need specific, direction and an action plan that delivers real results. When that doesnt happen, most people ultimately give up and quit.

Dieting is rigid and unnatural. It involves sacrifice and suffering...which builds resentment on many levels. In fact, the only thing we really lose is ourself-esteem - after failing, inevitably, again and again.

At Weston Women Only Bootcamp we dont diet. Instead we put into a new, healthy LIFESTYLE that you'll love- with foods you'll really enjoy. Day after day!

My name is Master Chad Wilbur and I am the owner of Martial Arts Fitness Academy. When I was a child, I began my martial arts journey and the positive impact it had on my life was remarkable. It was always my dream to someday own my own school and when I opened Martial Arts Fitness Academy in 2001, I made a commitment to our community in Tallahassee to create an enjoyable environment for students to improve their fitness while building confidence they can carry into their everyday lives. It is my privilege and honor to take the the knowledge I have received in my own martial arts training and pass it on to the students at my school.
MARTIAL ARTS IS NOT JUST KICKS AND PUNCHES!

We teach all of our members to focus on and be present in the moment. In this age of distractions and sensory overload, this is a skill which returns immediate results in all aspects of one’s life. Here are some interesting facts about Martial Arts Fitness Academy:

    Our members are from all walks of life – we have students, attorneys, doctors, engineers, military and law enforcement all training in a fun, team-oriented family environment.
    We have kids that have been training for years that leave to top colleges and universities in the country, thanks in part to the discipline and focus on hard work they learned through martial arts. This is something we take a great amount of pride in.
    There are always new generations of individuals and families coming in to pursue the ongoing legacy. It is a tradition in martial arts to pass down the knowledge one receives in their training and many students become instructors, often ending up owning their own schools.

It is our goal to inspire strength, discipline, confidence and focus in our students, to help them discover their inner leader. I believe every child has the potential to be a leader, they just need someone to believe in them. As a parent myself, I understand the challenges of raising a confident and focused child in an age where there are more distractions than ever.

And while the kids have their fun, our adult program is second to none. From traditional martial arts to more modern self-defense styles, there is something for everyone at Martial Arts Fitness Academy. If you are looking to burn major calories, learn self-defense moves and get in the best shape of your life, you must come and check out our adult program.

Imagine yourself as a stronger, more confident individual in the best shape of your life. I want to personally invite you to take advantage of our introductory trial offer, and turn that vision into a reality.

It would be a privilege to meet you and your child to have them step into the wonderful world of martial arts.";"http://martialartstally.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mafa-logo.png";"http://martialartstally.com/karate-for-kids/";"The Karate for Kids programs offered at Martial Arts Fitness Academy, in Tallahassee, FL, are a great way to instill virtues like integrity, courtesy, and respect in children of the local Tallahassee community. Our state of the art Karate programs are proven tools to help teach children valuable life lessons. Some of the skills and values we foster are respect, self-discipline, self-control, and the ability to safely defend themselves when needed. These life skills and attributes help each child achieve a “Personal Victory” in Martial Arts – and in life! Our professional instructors are equipped with these same skills and values as a result of their own training, and pass them on to children in our Karate for Kids programs to promote their progression through adolescence into adulthood.

The Karate for Kids programs are defined by age appropriate programs and classes specifically designed to promote physical development, while expanding the mental capabilities of younger Karate kids in the family.

He is one of the highest ranked Uechi-Ryu Karate practitioners in the United States.  Additionally, he has studied Jujutsu and Judo for over 20 years and is continually working to improve his techniques and teaching methods.
“When I started martial arts training as a teenager, I wanted to learn how to fight and be a”tough guy”. However, what I learned from over 25 years of martial arts training is that being the best fighter pales in comparison to everything else I have gained from my training.

As a young, cocky teenager I had a short fuse and a lot to learn. I was lucky to have some true karate masters to serve as my role models. The skill of their techniques was and still is amazing,  yet they carry themselves without a drop of arrogance.

My teachers taught me that having the ability to hurt someone carries with it a great responsibility never to be misused. Self defense should only be used as a last resort when there are no other options. I personally had to work on my own self-control and how to use my skills to help others.

Martial Arts have taught me how to think before I act, pay attention to detail, and finish what I start. I strongly urge parents to explore martial arts training for their children!”

Come experience firsthand the benefits of our Martial Arts and Bootcamp Fitness classes.

    Respect,
    Self-Control, and
    Self-Discipline

Children need to be taught how to push and challenge themselves to become successful in a supportive environment. At The Dojo, your kids will develop a “never give up” winning spirit. They will also benefit from improving all aspects of their physical and mental fitness.
We teach two styles of kids martial arts classes at our school:

    Traditional Uechi-Ryu Okinawan Style Karate
    Jujutsu (balance disruption and leverage to gain advantage over an attacker)

These martial arts will teach them not only how to defend themselves, but when and when not to use these empowering skills. Your kids will learn that there is a great responsibility in having these abilities and not to misuse their techniques.
Self-Defense Against Bullies

Once kids learn how to defend themselves they usually never have to. Kids Martial Arts Classes enable your child carry to themselves with confidence, which makes them less likely to be a target for bullies.

Self-confidence is the greatest deterrent to being a bully magnet. Confidence developed through martial arts training is earned and not falsely given.

Why Choose Our Martial Arts School?

There are many different kids martial arts schools in town, and it might seem overwhelming to know which school is the right one for your kids.  The best way to do your research is to visit the school in person and watch a couple of classes:

    Are the students enjoying themselves?
    Does the instructor control the class well?
    Does the instructor engage the students and provide positive reinforcement?

Come pay us a visit at The Dojo, and talk with Chief Instructor Ryan Dean. You’ll find that we care about the advancement of your children in more ways than just the martial arts!

Far too many children are bullied and have no idea what to do or if there is anything they can do.  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu helps children gain self-confidence and self-discipline to cope with these situations in a nonviolent manner.

Is your child spending too much time indoors?  With many schools cutting programs like PE and recess, it is more important than ever for kids to get out of the house and play.  BJJ provides a fun, safe environment for them to learn self-defense and other practical life skills. 

Is your child shy or introverted? Technology is a great tool for kids to gain more information about the world around them. Unfortunately for children who might struggle to socialize it could prevent them from exploring the world right outside their door.  BJJ also teaches kids how to listen to  instructions and communicate with others. These are vital social skills they will use for the rest of their lives.

Learning Brazilian jiu jitsu is one of the best gifts you can provide your child. It provides character development and personal growth that will impact every area of their life, for the rest of their life. It is a fun way for kids to get into fantastic shape, build confidence, learn respect, improve discipline, and prevent bullying.

Our Kids Program operates in a fun and nurturing environment, where kids flourish and learn important life lessons like:

    Through self-discipline, commitment, and perseverance, you can accomplish anything.
    Improving focus and concentration helps you ignore distractions and fully engage in lessons at school, in sport, and at home.
    Patience pays off.
    When you are healthy and fit, you feel less stress, have more confidence, and live a happier & more positive life.

Bullying

Our Kids Program will empower your kids to prevent or discourage bullying without violence. Through appropriate and effective self-defense techniques as well as verbal jiu jitsu techniques, we instill the self-esteem and confidence needed to allow kids to defuse confrontations before they escalate, and to protect and defend themselves in the event they are attacked.

Bullying is the #1 social issue and epidemic in schools today, and it has ripple effects throughout our communities.

    Every 7 minutes a child is bullied in the US
    Every month, 3 million children miss school due to fear of bullying
    90% of 4th through 8th graders report being victims of bullying
    1 out of 10 students drop out of school due to repeated bullying
    70% of students believe schools respond poorly to bullying and that adult help is infrequent

Don't let your child be a victim!

The core of our program is based on Brazilian Jiu Jitsu because:

    It does not rely on strength or size, so is effective against larger and stronger attackers,
    It is safe because it's focused on restraint and control rather than striking, and
    It is considered the most practical and effective self-defense system in the world.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is the martial art used in ""Bully-Proofing"" programs that have been praised by Oprah, CNN, and parents worldwide.
Our kids program was developed by BJJ black belt & Kids Program Instructor, Derek Kaivani who has been teaching kids for more than 5 years. The program includes techniques, games, drills, live sparring, & life skills discussions. Currently, our program accommodates kids age 6-12.

HOBBY
By giving them a hobby that encourages being active and physical, you will ultimately reduce the amount of time they have to participate in the hobbies that could cause them to be unhealthy.

SELF DEFENSE
Boxing will allow your children to be able to defend themselves if they ever need to. This can be an extremely valuable tool for your children to learn because the world can be very dangerous.

DISCIPLINE
By teaching your kids boxing mechanics, you will effectively be teaching your children control and discipline. In order to be a good boxer, a person must be disciplined and go through the motions with precision.

This twenty-four year commitment to being the best in martial arts training has resulted in a sterling reputation for owner, Joey Imperatori, and his motivated staff. Imperatori Martial Arts is the premier karate and jiu-jitsu studio in Atlanta.    New families are immediately impressed with the thriving and encouraging environment that inspires practitioners to be their best. Children and teenagers internalize lessons that improve self-confidence, goal achievement, and school grades: the tools that make success in life immanent. Adults become more fit, flexible and master skills of self-defense.

Located in Sandy Springs, just north of Buckhead, Imperatori Martial Arts is a spacious, 8000 square foot facility that includes two large workout rooms with state of the art mats for both karate and jiu-jitsu, a large viewing area for parents, a playroom for siblings and an area for children to finish homework.   Ten instructors combine efforts to teach over 60 high-energy classes each week: classes that are divided by both age and skill level. Our curriculums are designed to motivate beginners to reach new belts, and there are hundreds of students – with years of experience – on a path to Black Belt.    We invite you to visit our studio, so that you might see for yourself, why Joey Imperatori’s commitment to excellence has made Imperatori Martial Arts a true Atlanta icon! ";"http://www.imperatorimartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Crown-2.jpg";"http://www.imperatorimartialarts.com/karate/youth-karate/";"Joey Imperatori has a karate studio that is truly unique. The atmosphere promotes a drive towards excellence. It is a pleasure to see children that began in the youngest classes nearly a decade ago entering their teenage years with an inner strength that separates them from peers – teenagers that are growing into focused, self-confident young adults.
Self-Confidence

Joey Imperatori teaches children that believing in yourself is the key to tapping into an inner strength. The students train hard, and by mastering a karate technique or attaining a stripe or belt, learn that when one applies this inner strength, success is imminent.
Delayed Gratification

Goals at Imperatori Karate are clearly defined. Stripes for belts are the short-term goals that are the small steps of a long journey. New belts are the intermediate goals; a child learns that consistency and perserverance, in spite of occasional disappointment, are the key to attaining the next belt. A Black Belt, and then a lifetime of training beyond, is possible once the child internalizes the principles of gradual growth promoted by years of patience, refinement, self-discipline, and commitment. These are valuables lessons that are applied to achievement in all areas of a child’s life.

Fitness Forever
Kicking, punching, blocking, stretching – there are few sports that involve every muscle in the body. There are even fewer that instill an exercise ethic that will continue into adulthood. Imperatori Karate teaches body/mind integration.
Academic Achievement

Imperatori Karate students are proud to bring their report cards to karate class. Parents are delighted to turn in a Home Achievement Report when a child tests for a new belt. When marks are high, Joey praises with the deserved reinforcement. When marks are deficient, or a child is settling for mediocrity, a correlation between prior success in karate and future success in school or home is made clear: if you can learn to excel in karate, then you can excel anywhere and everywhere else!

Our Gracie Brazilian Jiu-jitsu program gives you the skills and physical conditioning you need to resist your attacker and escape. We teach you how to avoid

being targeted by predators. Should the unthinkable happen, we teach you how to defend your position against a much larger attacker with the ultimate goal of getting back safely to your family.  Of course we will tea

ch you the skills to finish the fight.  Our Gracie Jiu-jitsu program gives you a variety of solutions based on the most common attacks, grabs, chokes and other attacks, both from a standing position and the ground. NO other martial self defense program gives you this proven realistic array of skills. This program is so effective, the US Air Force has adopted Jiu-jitsu as their core self defense program for their female air personnel.  Learning to punch and kick is fun, but for self defense, it is inefficient, tends to escalate the violence and when facing a size mismatch can be a very poor option.   

Keep in mind, Gracie Jiu-jitsu was created by a 135 pound man, Helio Gracie, specifically for smaller people against larger opponents.

Come see why our Atlanta program is so popular with women. Our facility is clean and professional. Our secret for providing you the skills you need is by making our classes fun, not just instructive. And did we mention you will get in great shape? Our classes are relaxed and taught by long time martial artist and advanced Gracie black belt Steve Brown.  Interested in a seminar? Steve has brought his skills to many Fortune 500 companies, law enforcement and communities who have requested women’s self defense programs.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu evolved into an art form that does not rely upon strength and size to defend against a bigger stronger attacker but instead uses a combination of techniques that utilize leverage and joint holds to stop and neutralize the attacker.

At The Martial Arts Center Atlanta, we believe in whole body wellness. Our goal is to provide self-defense training and physical conditioning in a focused and disciplined environment. The results are a healthier body, a calmer spirit and a more focused mind.

More Than A Sport & Just As Fun
We have separate classes for Dragons (5-7 years old) and Tigers (8-12 years old).
Boys and girls train together in a safe & encouraging atmosphere.
Our Children's Karate Classes are 45 minutes long, and offer basic to advanced karate, games and friendship.
Every class begins with stretching and warm-ups, followed by the day's lesson and a ""game"" incorporating the day's lessons.
Your children do not have to have any special skills to excel in our program. The only thing they must have is a sense of fun and a desire to learn really cool moves!

Our Karate Classes Build Self-Esteem
Our Reward System is the key to improving self-esteem. As children move up in rank and earn the honor of the next color belt, we celebrate this achievement with a public belt-tying ceremony. Children experience an enormous sense of pride when they are recognized by their peers. They soon realize that achievement feels good!

Our Karate Classes Improve Confidence
The physical aspect of karate improves agility, balance, coordination and reflexes, translating into better performance in team sports. It's not unusual for children who are ""picked last in school sports"" by their fellow students to begin being ""picked early"". Children also gain a sense of confidence as they become aware of their ability to defend themselves.

Our Karate Classes Help with Shyness
As confidence grows, shyness fades away. As your child advances in rank, he/she will have fellow students asking them how to do certain moves, thus breaking the ice and making it easier to develop friends.

Our Karate Classes Teach Respect and Courtesy
We have a central principle in our teaching called ""Karate Ni Sente Nashi."" It means, ""There is no first attack in karate."" In our classes we emphasize that Karate is for self-defense only. It is the ultimate sign of respect when a child learns that it is improper to hurt another human being for any reason other than self-defense.
The value of having good manners and courtesy is emphasized in our karate classes here at The Martial Arts Center. We require our students to lead by example in the way they act, speak, perform and help. The higher ranks will be asked to assist those who are new in learning their basic techniques. This gives them a sense of responsibility and accountability for their knowledge and actions. Assisting in class is a privilege, which all children desire.";"N/A";"N/A";"MMA";"N/A";"http://tmacenter.com/class-times/";"Monday: 3:00 PM - 9:00 PM

Unit 2 was founded by a small group of martial artists and professional fighters who, like many of you, were fed up with corporate “big box” gym.  Gyms that lacked the equipment and programs needed to achieve the elite levels of fitness required for competition.  The founders designed Unit 2 to have a team-like atmosphere.  A gym where people can train hard, learn from some of the most skilled martial artists in the business and see results.  Since opening in 2007 Unit2 has done just that.

Unit 2 Fitness is an award-winning gym having been voted the Best Gym, Best Cardio Class, Best CrossFit, and Best Martial Arts gym in Atlanta.  TapOut Magazine has rated us as one of the Best Grappling Academies in the United States and Men’s Health referred to Unit 2 as the best place to get a “hardcore” workout in Atlanta.

With so much instructional talent under one roof, it’s no surprise that Unit 2 produces WEC World Champions, Iron Ring Champions, Strikeforce and UFC winners.  Not to mention a winning history in grappling in Georgia.  Unit 2 Fitness has taken people who work in corporate America and turned them into competitive athletes at the national level.  We can help you get into the best shape of your life.  Come on!  Be one of our success stories!

BJJ promotes that a smaller, weaker person can defend against a bigger stronger assailant by using proper technique and leverage.

Our programs start at approximately 7 years of age and extend until 12 years of age.  13+ kids may take the adult classes.

Our Mini Spider Program is for kids aged 7-12 and meets three times a week for 45 minutes each class. In this program you can expect:

    Teaches principles and techniques of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
    Have fun in a safe and disciplined environment
    Teaches crucial life skills, like respect, self-control and discipline.
    Incorporates skills that are crucial in adolescent development
    Emphasizes how to react in “bully” type of situations
    Helps develop gross motor skills and agility
    Aids children in developing concept of teamwork and cooperation

Each class consists of a warm-up, technique portion and sparring with teammates in a safe yet fun environment.

You DO NOT pay for belts in our program; each belt is tested for once the instructor believes the student is ready for the next level. The belts in our program are EARNED.

Needed for each class:

    BJJ Uniform (Gi)
    Mouthpiece (optional)
    Water or sports drink
    Athletic clothing to wear under the Gi; you must wear a shirt and shorts under the gi.

Classes are Mondays and Wednesdays at 4:30PM for Spiderlings and Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 5:30PM for Mini Spiders.  We also have a bi-monthly Saturday 9:00AM Saturday competition class for Mini Spiders.";"http://www.unit2fitness.com/classes/martial-arts/women-martial-arts-and-self-defense/";"Unit 2 Fitness offers Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for women. These classes are similar to our regular classes, however, only women may attend and the techniques used are specifically for women.  This is an excellent way for you to learn self defense techniques that are proven to work in the real world.  You will learn to drill each technique with a partner in class and learn to use them in real time.

This class is excellent for people that are interested in learning martial arts in an environment exclusively for women.  As a self defense system few programs have proven themselves as well as BJJ.  The only way to be able to defend yourself is to regularly and consistently train the movements and techniques you will use.  We focus on techniques that can be used to immobilize larger and stronger opponents.

Our women’s Brazilian Jiu-Jisu class also trains for competition in many of the local tournaments and national tournaments.  Several of our participants have won local, regional, national, and world titles.

All women in the program are also welcome to do any Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu class at the gym in addition to the women’s only classes.

Benefits from Every Class.

Action-Packed
Fitness and Exercise.

Action-packed games, activities, and
exercises give kids a great workout
from head to toe.

They get stronger, healthier and more fit within just a couple weeks. These fun exercises also help maintain a healthy weight!

The best part? The fitness is disguised as FUN! All your child will know is that they’re having a blast. But you and I know they’re also getting the exercise they need.


Self-Defense From Strangers, Bullies, and More.

Make no mistake about it: While our classes are tons of fun, we also cover the ""serious"" stuff too.

We teach kids about handling strangers... bullies... and more.

However, the first thing we teach is diplomacy. We give your child the tools they need to ""talk it out"" first. Violence is ALWAYS a last resort!


Powerful Character Development Breeds Discipline, Focus, and Respect.

For thousands of years, martial arts has been one of the best kept secrets for giving kids the skills they need for success in life.

Through inspiring stories and talks, as well as the process of learning the techniques, kids develop amazing traits, like:

Respect, discipline, focus, and goal setting.

I hope your child will never have to use their self-defense skills. But I guarantee these other skills will come in handy EVERY day for the rest of their life.


Fun, Fun, Fun!!!

While kids work hard and train hard in our classes...

... They also smile and laugh a LOT, too!

After all, these are kids we’re dealing with here! Our classes are a great place for kids to socialize, make friends, get support, and have a blast.

Since 1981 our mission has always been to provide the best martial arts experience available. The Dojo offers an unmatched commitment to excellence:

    Professional Martial Arts Magazine has ranked The Dojo in the top five out of 20,000 martial arts studios in America.
    We have promoted more than 1,000 students to black belt level.
    The Dojo prides itself on developing and maintaining the most effective methods of building character through martial arts training.
    We teach the most exciting and practical form of mixed martial arts ever developed--American Karate.
    Our unique mixture of styles and training methods include the most useful techniques from the most effective disciplines, including Tae Kwon Do, Jiu Jitsu, and Philippine martial arts, just to name a few.
    The Dojo offers fun-filled, action-packed, programs designed specifically for every age -- kids, teens and adults.

Our Core Discipline -- American Karate

American Karate is the “melting pot” of martial arts. We can trace its roots back through Japan, Okinawa, Korea, China, and even India. Through both adaptation and innovation, American Karate has developed into what has become widely accepted as one of the most practical style of martial arts taught in the world. However, at The Dojo we respect traditional martial art methods while taking advantage of the newest techniques developed.

The martial arts have transcended their violent origins and are much more than fighting. True martial arts training stresses character development, discipline and respect. Self-defense, physical fitness and competition are some of the other benefits our students enjoy. 

The Dojo Philosophy
We recognize that each student comes to The Dojo with a unique starting point and a unique set of capabilities. Each student also has personal goals they want to achieve with martial arts training. Consequently, we provide individualized training and constant motivation and encouragement to create a true sense of accomplishment.

Our aim is to maximize the student's physical progress and mental discipline while enhancing the appreciation for the spirit and ethos of martial arts. Our teaching strategies have been highly successful:

    We will train our students with courtesy, patience, and perseverance.
    We will always conduct ourselves professionally.
    We will know our students on a personal level and maximize their results by applying student specific motivation.
    Our service will be of the highest quality and will meet or exceed the student's expectations in every encounter with us.
    We will communicate constantly with our students and their families.
    We will use every medium at our disposal to constantly - and consistently - make the martial arts experience effective and rewarding.

Every student will know how much we care and will quickly feel the true sense of a being part of our martial arts community.


Advisory Panel
At The Dojo, earning a black belt means earning the approval and endorsement of the nation's top martial artists and self-defense experts.

The Dojo Advisory Panel is a virtual Who's Who of the martial arts as well as the nation's top SWAT team commanders and law enforcement executives. Our black belt tests are judged by the very best competitors and practitioners of forms, weapons and fighting. Many varying and contrasting styles are represented on The Dojo Advisory Panel.

Our Advisory Panel also regularly reviews our curriculum, teaching methods and techniques. They continually give us feedback and comments, making sure we offer our students the very finest in martial arts training.";"https://scontent.fdac2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c52.52.647.647/s200x200/1010190_444346228994006_754428889_n.png?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeHvbQiZkk9wHU73cj08ovD6kffXxzefjGK4pJAGyoKgUDz85KNDdqqd-e2V4ZKiAKgQGZKLHV9Ar9fMYoCfCpHT1nr0FcqElGqi6P4awIaRwQ&oh=ffd826cc4072219d7d6d1d00d57ed266&oe=5B4B6D47";"http://www.teamdojo.com/Karate_Programs__kids_karate.aspx";"Why Enroll Your Child in The Dojo

In this 10-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 15 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to Pink Belt!

If you have no previous martial arts experience and you want to learn how to defend yourself in a fun, safe, and cooperative learning environment, Women Empowered is for you.

Upon enrolling, we will issue you a Women Empowered attendance card on which we will track your progress every step of the way.

Step 2: Develop Your Reflexes

Once you complete each of the 10 Women Empowered lessons twice, you will qualify to participate in the Reflex Development (RD) classes where you will learn how to combine the 15 techniques to address the most common occurrences in a real self-defense situation.

Through muscle memory, students will be able to defend themselves from bullies in real life situations without having to remember what they learned. Classes also focus on building integrity, character, and good morals in every student. Students are taught to use what they learn in each class for SELF DEFENSE PURPOSES ONLY and are otherwise taught to treat their peers with respect. Students are split up by age groups (5 to 7 years; 8-10 years and 11-15 years) so that they can learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in a safe and controlled manner.

Why Take Kids BJJ at KnuckleUp

At KnuckleUp Fitness, we provide instruction in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, the ultimate grappling art for kids! Like wrestling and Judo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu teaches the use of technique over strength.

Kids, no matter how big or small, learn how to use their size to their advantage to counter all kinds of punches, kicks, and holds. They also learn to use the opponent against themselves to achieve throws, take-downs, and position control on the ground, which can stop any attacker no matter their size or strength.

All kids classes are taught by our experienced children’s instructors at the same time as our other adult classes, so parents can easily work out when their kids are in class! In addition, classes are offered at all levels of experience and age groups, ranging from 5 to 12 years old.

Students also get the opportunity to compete against one another in Knuckleup’s Competitive Sparring League. This inter-club competition is designed to help kids develop a positive competitive attitude and spirit.

Thousands of Atlanta’s parents have attributed their children’s success to The KnuckleUp Kids programs, including:

This philosophy, developed by chief instructor Sensei Toru Shimoji, is best explained in an examination of the translation of the three Japanese words combined in the name.  If you separate the Japanese kanji characters that make up the word Jinsendo, its underlying meaning is brought to light. The first one “jin” (root pronunciation “hito”) is literally translated as person, or human race.  ""Sen"""", the second character implies line, path or projection. The last kanji “do” (root pronunciation “michi"") means path, road or “the way of”. Putting them all together, “people line way”, is the literal translation.

However, all of the above can be further expressed as, “The way of actualizing human potential”.  Jinsendo is the projection of human spirit to continually evolve with others in a like-minded endeavor that adheres to three guiding principles:

    honor the spirit of free will

    rise above confrontational energy

    seek cooperation through mutual engagement.

 

The Nishiyama System of Traditional Karate

​

The late Hidetaka Nishiyama was one of original founders of Japan Karate Association (JKA), and established and ran theAmerican Amateur Karate Federation (AAKF) until his death in 2008. As a direct student of Gichin Funakoshi (the founder of modern-day karate), Master Nishiyama pioneered in movement analysis and development of techniques associated with JKA-style Karate, from performance as well as from pedagogical perspective. Eventually, he coined the term Traditional Karate, which he preferred over labels such as ""Shotokan"" or ""JKA-style"", as his method and approach to training ultimately applied to all styles of karate, and ultimately any movement art or sport. He founded the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) to establish an international governing body of Traditional Karate competition. His lasting impact to the Karate world is deep and wide, still influencing Karate enthusiasts globally.";"https://scontent.fdac3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/16711981_10154423528842615_5021818919455934310_n.png?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeHGC0REZnQs3LMlH7rIfwDsQdQ0bUENpbutDSYKwmufcq0taRxJDQ_nsq43C8C2esrO7tx4vVX0Sm_iSrFfJZ74aU7Q9Yq_HpDGwvCdReCdMg&oh=068dc40724fcc2b3056fba27f81a383f&oe=5B08B3A3";"https://www.karateatl.com/youth-karate";"Youth Karate at Jinsendo...

Come Meet Our Staff
We'd love for you to come talk with us about your goals and tour the academy. You're welcome to watch a class in action or if you're ready to get your feet wet we offer a free trial class. Either way, we'd love to meet you. David Bartow, Instruction is led by Master Instructor Bartow Executive Director and Founder of Karate USA. Master Bartow has been training for over 35 years and teaching for more than 30 years. All students who reach Black Belt are certified through the WTF under Master Bartow's signed approval. Master Bartow oversees operations, exams, tournaments and special events. He also teaches classes at Karate USA. We also employ assistant instructors who are all certified black belts.
Changing Lives and Changing Community
When students come to train they're greeted by friendly instructors who provide a fun and supportive learning environment. Our academy is clean and bright. Our goal of changing lives and changing community through martial arts is evident in every minute of class time.  Success for us is determined by how well students take what they learn on the mat -- character, confidence, integrity, self-control, humility, perseverance, and courtesy -- and apply it off the mat.  Classes for K-12 grade students re-enforce our ""Black Belt Attitude"" with monthly chore sheets (cleaning room, showing respect at home, practicing self control).  Students K-12 are also rewarded at Karate USA for maintaining excellent grades and conduct at school. The real-world evidence of this mission is found in our SuperHero Project -- a community service initiative that teaches students leadership through project management. Over 300 projects have been completed by Karate USA students and uploaded to the online portfolio. When we tell our students to be the change they want to see in the world, it's not just talk. Karate USA students set the example.
Leading the Way
Students will lead by example when their teachers and schools lead by example. That's why we are constantly updating and tweaking our curriculum. We are proud to be the first school in the area to develop a comprehensive community outreach initiative, to supplement our main martial arts training program with submission grappling, and to launch a  meaningful Black Belt test -- The Ultimate Black Belt Test. We are Partners in Education with dozens of local PTA, elementary and middle schools providing them with tens of thousands of dollars in donations and scholarships each year. Martial arts is more than amazing physical training, it's a powerful tool for making mental, social, and emotional change with the right program and the right leadership.
Un-Matched Instruction Quality
The majority of students just want to belong to a program that they can fully participate in. They love that martial arts training is all about what they can do and when they come to class they know they won't be sitting on the bench. Whether you're uncoordinated and weak or an all-star athlete we have a place in our program for you. The fun part is watching your transformation regardless of where you started. Everyone has more potential that needs to be unlocked and our instructors know how to do exactly that. In 2005 we launched our competition team which competes at the state, regional, and national level. Since then we have trained over 30 National Champions in Olympic Taekwondo. These aren't students who came to us as amazing athletes. Quality of instruction is about helping regular students accomplish things they never thought were possible. We want to help you next. ";"http://karate-usa.com/2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/kusanewslogo.png";"http://www.karate-usa.com/little-ninjas/";"Your child needs a structured program to channel their energy, improve their focus and listening skills, and aid their physical development.

Description: Enrolling your kids in martial arts is a great way for them to pour their energy into physical activity and away from video games and the TV. They will gain many benefits from these classes that will stay with them for many years. This program is excellent for kids to get into shape and make new friends at the same time.

The Kids’ Martial Arts Program at Team Octopus incorporates various forms of martial arts, including Karate, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Boxing and Wrestling, for children ages 7 – 12. Classes include warm ups, new techniques, drills, and live rolls.

Mondays and Wednesdays focus on stand-up martial arts, such as Karate and Boxing. Tuesdays and Thursdays are Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Wrestling, which follow a curriculum designed so that they will learn and continuously practice the fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, as well as progress onward to learn different techniques each time they attend class.

Kids these days are very different from kids of the 90s, 80s, and so forth. Instead of running around outside or building forts in the backyard, kids these days choose to be on their smart phones and tablets.

At Team Octopus, we are serious about your child’s success and want to help your child build self-esteem while simultaneously learn about respect, self-discipline, and team work.";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay Thai, Fitness Kickboxing, MMA, Boxing";"N/A";"https://mico.myiclubonline.com/iclub/members/signin.htm?clubNumber=6946#classes";"Monday: 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM, 4:30 PM - 9:00 PM

5 Reasons Kids Should Train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

As parents, we all know that kids need to stay active and learn how to be a part of a team. Martial arts are a great way for kids to do both these things, but the added benefit is that it’s a year-round program. Instead of seasonal sports where progress is slower, kids who participate consistently in a martial arts program will see guaranteed changes in behavior at home and school. At Kenny Kim Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, we focus on building the kids life skills while they are making friends and learning martial arts. While we can think of 10,000 reasons why kids should train BJJ, here are the top 5 reasons why our kids martial arts program is so important:

1. Physical benefits: Children who train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) are learning a healthy lifestyle by staying active, which, as most parents know, is difficult to do in the age of video games and social media! Staying active burns calories, increases good cholesterol, decreases bad cholesterol, increases flexibility, increases balance and coordination, improves fitness, maintains healthy joints and keeps the heart rate up, all while learning how to defend yourself! Proper martial arts training should be fun and educational, all while increasing a child’s self-confidence, which can in turn manifest itself in many positive ways of a child’s life.

2. Self-Esteem: Self-esteem is developed in martial arts due to the ability to grow and set goals. At first, kids in BJJ class start off setting short-term goals (getting a feel for the movements). These goals are realized after a few short months and are rewarded with a new belt or stripe. The student realizes that the effort and work put forth in the martial arts class pays off; in this case, a new belt colors. Once they realize that BJJ is for life they begin to reach for a higher goal, attaining the coveted black belt, but along the way, self-esteem and self-confidence is growing, along with the child.

3. Bully proof: Bullying is a well-documented and growing problem in schools these days. And with no signs of slowing down, martial arts training can give much needed tools to the child on how to better deal with bullies and bullying situations. Martial arts teach children to stand up for themselves and for others if there is a bullying situation. Preventing bullying does not mean resorting to violence, it means having the confidence to stand up for what is right. However, what’s worse for parents than learning their child is being a bully, is that their child is a bully him/herself. At Kenny Kim Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, we focus on developing strong human beings; learning to help others, not hurt them.

4. Mental Health: Apart from self-esteem, BJJ is very mentally challenging which helps kids develop character. Compared to other martial arts, it can take up to 10 yrs. for adults to reach black belt because of the complexity of the art. The ability of a BJJ student to learn how to deal with obstacles in a controlled environment gives the benefit of increased mental health because the student develops the ever-important “Never Give Up” attitude. That attitude is imperative in developing leaders and strong individuals who don’t see a limit to what they can accomplish and learn how to navigate their way through challenges. Along the way, your child will gain self-discipline, self-confidence, focus, and respect, just to name a few of the many mental benefits of training.

5. Awareness: The last thing any parent wants is a lost child. Typically, the child is fine and found in a few minutes. But what if the worst-case scenario presented itself?  Realistically, can a child defend themselves against an adult? Probably not. But a child can learn how to be aware of their surroundings, and take the necessary steps to prevent dangerous situations. BJJ teaches children to be flexible, make quick decisions, and take action while remaining calm.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"https://kennykimbjj.com/schedule/";"Monday: 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM

Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling but especially ground fighting. It was derived from the Japanese martial art of Kodokan Judo in the early 20th century,[2][1] which was itself then a recently-developed system (founded in 1882), based on multiple schools (or Ryu) of Japanese jujutsu.

It promotes the principle that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger assailant using leverage and proper technique; most notably, by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat them. BJJ can be trained for self defense, sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition.[3] Sparring (commonly referred to as 'rolling') and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition.

Head Coach Muhsin Corbbrey is a Judo and Japanese Jiu Jitsu Black belt as well as being a brown belt under master instructor Lloyd Irvin.

Kids Boxing is a combat sport where two participants, generally of similar weight, fight each other with their fists. Boxing is supervised by a referee and is typically engaged in during a series of one to three-minute intervals called rounds. There are three ways to win. Victory is achieved if the opponent is knocked down and unable to get up before the referee counts to ten seconds (a Knockout, or KO) or if the opponent is deemed too injured to continue (a Technical Knockout, or TKO). If there is no stoppage of the fight before an agreed number of rounds, a winner is determined either by the referee's decision or by judges' scorecards.

Although fighting with fists comes naturally to people, evidence of fist-fighting contests first appear on ancient Sumerian, Egyptian and Minoan reliefs. The ancient Greeks provide us our first historical records of boxing as a formal sport; they codified a set of rules and staged tournaments with professionals. The birth hour of boxing as a sport may be its acceptance as an Olympic game as early as 688 BC. Modern boxing evolved in Europe, particularly Great Britain.

Coach Stormin Normin Jones is a former Light Heavyweight boxing champion with over 50 fights to his credit.

Kids Muay Thai is a form of hand to hand combat practiced in large parts of the world. Muay Thai has a long history in Thailand and is the country's national sport. Muay Thai is referred to as ""The Art of Eight Limbs"", as the hands, shins, elbows, and knees are all used extensively in this art. A practitioner of Muay Thai thus has the ability to execute strikes using eight ""points of contact,"" as opposed to ""two points"" (fists) in Western boxing and ""four points"" (fists, feet) used in the primarily sport-oriented forms of martial arts. This undoubtedly makes Muay Thai the most effective and devastating striking art.

CTC is a Manu Ntoh affiliate. Manu is a 6 time Muay Thai world champion. Coach Muhsin Corbbrey is a professional Muay Thai Fighter and has trained extensively in Thailand.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, or BJJ, is a self defense system that focuses on grappling or ground fighting.

The art was derived from the Japanese martial art of Kodokan Judo in the early 20th century.

It teaches that a smaller, and sometimes weaker, person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by utilizing proper technique and leverage.

The most common ways to defeat a bigger opponent is through joint locks or chokeholds.

Mitsuyo Maeda began to travel the world in 1904 doing Judo demonstrations and challenging Boxers, wrestlers and other martial artists to fights.

He arrived in Brazil November 14, 1914.

In Brazil, in the northern state of Para, he befriended Gastão Gracie, an influential businessman, who helped Maeda get established. To show his gratitude, Maeda offered to teach Judo to Gastão’s oldest son, Carlos Gracie. Carlos learned for a few years and eventually passed his knowledge to his brothers.

One day, when Helio Gracie was 16 years old, a student showed up for class when Carlos was not around. Helio, who had memorized all the techniques from watching his brothers teach, offered to start the class. When the class was over, Carlos showed up and apologized for his delay. The student asked for Helio to continue being his instructor, Helio Gracie then gradually developed Gracie Jiu Jitsu as an adaptation from Judo as he was unable to do many Judo moves.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu become one of the most famous forms of martial arts in 1994 when the Gracie Family started the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

When the smaller guys were tapping out the bigger stronger guys everyone knew they needed to start learning BJJ.";"https://scontent.fdac2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c2.0.320.320/p320x320/13466470_793558477411488_4752558735734539079_n.jpg?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeFBDpm_TpkpZ4AZi9ghG0WOm0gawHWd0yliI78bfX7FKBWwLnjPzGI11_syuGV2x55UKwlaLeFAdAiBtU1_Kjm-NEtpoazE_sZ45QBjllraYw&oh=2b5176bf5732a2e317c47a3eb6fcd13c&oe=5B09F060";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://jiujitsuhonolulu.com/schedule";"N/A";"Leandro Nyza";"1 Jiu Jitsu Class for FREE";"N/A";"https://web.facebook.com/JiuJitsuHonolulu/";"N/A";"https://youtu.be/Dsy_OQL1LVU";"N/A";"No";

Tiny Tots BJJ is for kids 1-3 years old and is an interactive 30 minute class guided by coach Daynin.  Parents will learn how to warm their toddlers up as well as drill with them and play games in order to focus on their muscle memory while preparing them for our Bully Prevention class when they get a little older.  This will be a great bonding experience for parent and child as well as an opportunity to learn while having fun together.

BULLY PREVENTION    (ages 3 - 5):   (Saturday Only)
Bully Prevention is a precursor to our Kids Class.  This class helps a child develop self confidence and self awareness so that they can start learning how to participate in a group setting with other kids.  We play games that will train their muscle memory  to do Jiu-Jitsu as they get older.  The kids also learn how to focus and participate as a group.  They learn the value of matching up and that losing has value as much as winning.  The kids train with each other and parents are encouraged to participate in any of the games and activities.
KIDS & BIG KIDS    (ages 5 - 7 and ages 7-9)
This class is designed to help kids learn how to protect themselves from bullies or anyone else who wants to hurt them.  It is also a pre-curser class to Jiu Jitsu.  What makes this class so unique is that the parents are welcome to participate with the child.  Each class is created so that the parent can do the program with the child so that the child may practice the techniques at home as well as in class allowing them to build confidence and muscle memory so that the techniques come to them naturally and instinctively.  If a parent is not available to participate with the child, that is OK too. There is no better gift to give your child, and yourself, then knowing that your child can defend their self against someone bigger and stronger in a threatening situation.  It not only gives you peace of mind, but your child as well.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://www.kahalajiujitsu.com/prices.html";"http://www.kahalajiujitsu.com/classes.html";"N/A";"Daynin Dashefsky";"Try a Class for FREE!

We promise that children will gain confidence, self-mastery and an understanding of basic techniques and principles necessary for Jiu-Jitsu mastery. Classes are taught by Black Belt Ronn Shiraki along with a team of certified Head Instructors. As one of Relson Gracie’s top students, Ronn Shiraki learned directly from the master and passes his training on to all his students. RSA strives to maintain an intimate class environment while exposing students to all levels of experience and skill. Classes are limited in size as we believe a higher instructor to child ratio is one of the most important parts of a martial-arts program for kids.

Kids’ Team Tuition:
RSA recommends that younger children train a minimum of twice a week, while older children train three to four times a week.

At RSA we are committed to providing training to all dedicated members. Help is available for members who are experiencing financial hardship. We do not use contracts or long-term agreements to lock in tuition payment. Please contact us for a free introductory class.
Philosophy:
At the Ronn Shiraki Academy we work hard and believe that active learning and strong relationships makes learning “The Way” satisfying and fun.

Kids Class Description
Flow is the state of consciousness where a person becomes completely immersed in the task at hand. It is the zone where athletes reach their peak performance. At RSA we gear our activities towards helping students harness their emotions to advance their learning, performance, and confidence.

The introduction video above demonstrates RSA students as they flow through drilling and sparring. Notice how they skillfully and effortlessly transition from position to position while maintaining an awareness of their partners’ whereabouts and the overall environment. Benefits of acquiring this skill include a greater sense of well-being and happiness.

Ages Four to Seven:
Class goals include teaching children listening skills, respect, and coordination that lay the foundation for quicker technical acquisition when students graduate to the older class.

Ages Seven to Fourteen:
Class goals focus on muscle memory and a deep conceptual understanding of the art. We look at each child and the student body as a work in progress. Our fluid coaching methodology takes into account both the individual on the mat and the group as a whole.

Benefits of Jiu-Jitsu for Kids:
At RSA we understand that kids need lots of movement, high levels of activity, and stimuli to keep their interest. Jiu-Jitsu at the RSA provides such an environment. We welcome high-energy children who need a safe space where they can exert pent-up mental and physical energy by rolling on the mat.";"http://www.ronnshiraki.com/womens-program.html";"Women's program description
Our professional instructors represent integrity and helpfullness in a relaxed class format that ensures a positive and safe experience for everyone.

Women’s class contact person:

The RSA Women's Team is for women who don't want to learn commercialized self-defense techniques in a cookie cutter program but learn in a fluid environment focused on the specific needs of the individual and team as a whole.

There are also some who are not comfortable with the idea of their partner rolling around with a bunch of random men. The RSA all women class is another option to consider.

""When attending safety instructor training on the mainland, many female tactical instructors want to improve in the Jiu-Jitsu part of the federal curriculum. Unfortunately, many of these same instructors are intimidated in their search for a gym (or they find the wrong gym) and stop after either getting hurt by an overly aggressive person or sparring partner lacking control. "" - Carter Lee, Instructor

​Our unique school ethos is centered around a professional environment; active training that pushes the body mind and spirit; authenticity; flexibility; and fun. If you like what you hear, you may also text or call our school manager, Justin, at 778-7207.

Whether you have never tried a martial arts sport or have been doing jiu-jitsu for years, all levels and types of students are welcome at TPJJ.


TPJJ opened under Master Relson Gracie 3rd Degree Black Belt Kaleo Auwae in January of 2005. Born and raised in Papakolea, Kaleo has been training under Master Relson Gracie since September 1994 in Hawaii during the early days and birth of the UFC.  Since then he has produced multiple champions with his teachings in all ranks and weight classes in both kids and adults divisions. He is also a champion himself being a NAGA (North American Grappling Association). 
 

From humble beginnings in 2005 as the Papakolea Fight Club, TPJJ was established to provide a positive influence and help both children and adults in the Papakolea area to improve not only their heath and fitness, but also to provide a positive alternative to stay on the right path. TPJJ has since grown to two locations in the heart of Honolulu: the Papakolea location at the Papakolea Community Development Center and the Kakaʻako location one block from SALT Kakaʻako. We are a close knit community of students, parents, and families who share a love for the art of jiu-jitsu. Whether you are just starting your journey or have been training for years, we invite you to see our facilities, meet the team, and try us out for a free week.";"https://scontent.fdac2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c33.33.410.410/s200x200/300804_253445681365576_1409582095_n.jpg?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeGZH3UKeo0HlHPvdU5joadwVXW4ys7tBRFJlqTB-61-x8muKNVrUl9Fp6Tj1dWWSx3ko6kWCIftBi3CovgI_Ey1SVHqi_Mn6vuD6c2wXRmysg&oh=2de221104dab5fe1f1233a1ece31eb40&oe=5B434EA2";"https://www.tpjjhnl.com/class-info";"KIDS BJJ

If you child is being bullied, has self-confidence struggles or just needs help with balance and coordination then Team Rhino Gracie Jiu-Jitsu can help!

Self-Defense

Studies suggest that “bullying” may be the leading cause of low self-esteem in children, and according to some surveys, less than 15% of kids actually report bullying to teachers or parents. Children’s inability to stand up to a bully is rooted in profound fear for their personal safety as well as peer pressure.

Think about your child’s situation for a moment?  They are caught in a place where they just want to be nice to others but someone mean is picking on them and tormenting them every day.   It could be at the bus stop, in English class or after school as they walk home.  They don’t want to get picked on any more but they don’t just don’t know what to do. They don’t want to “tell” on the bully to teachers or parents because they feel that nothing will happen and they will still have to deal with the bully every day and they don’t want to look “uncool” to their peers.  This is a terrible place to be and a prime reason why child suicide is the SECOND leading cause of death for ages 10-24. (2013 CDC WISQARS)  We can help your child stand up for themselves to any bully!


Our Kids Gracie/Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the best and safest self-defense martial arts a child can take period! That’s because no one has to get punched!


Our world famous Jiu-Jitsu program teaches your child to take an opponent down using simple and effective Gracie Jiu-Jitsu grappling techniques and then controlling the bully through getting on top and “making a bully give up.”  No one has to get hurt.


It’s very controlled, very easy and very fun!  In fact, your child won’t realize they are learning self-defense they’ll just think they are wrestling around and having a good time.  We can’t guarantee they won’t get picked on but we can guarantee they will have an effective “last resort,” that they can use where no one gets hurt.

Don’t rely on martial arts that require your child to primarily punch or kick.  They could end up hurting another child severely or worse yet end up breaking their own hand.  Gracie Jiu-Jitsu it’s fun and no one has to get hurt!

Character Development

For Rank advancement, in addition to “Mat Chats” in class, we require all students to turn in character worksheets that they will fill out on topics such as honesty, focus and helping others.  Students must also turn in Parent/Teacher worksheets every quarter so that our staff and instructors will know how your child is doing at school and home.  Students cannot rank advance if they are having issues at home or school. If we are teaching them to defend themselves it’s important that they know when the proper time to defend themselves is. It’s that important!

Balance and Coordination 

No Kid wants to be picked last for the school soccer or basketball team.  Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is the best martial art for developing hip movement which is essential in all sports.  It’s will also greatly improve their hand/eye coordination!  IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO EXCEL AT OTHER SPORTS THEN GRACIE JIU-JITSU IS THE ANSWER!

Our History

The Brazil-021 School of Jiu-Jitsu, was founded by Jiu-Jitsu black belts Andre “Negão” Terencio and Hannette Staack. It began with the vision of unifying its staff and creating a solid team, not only to train champions, but also to help its members become good citizens and family members. It is not a placereserved solely for the “tough” and powerful, but also welcomes women, children and people who are unsure of their abilities.The name and logo were inspired by Brazil and the state of Rio de Janeiro. The numbers, 021, signify the telephone area code for Rio de Janeiro where Jiu-Jitsu was initially most strongly developed. Jiu-Jitsu is now practiced worldwide, and because of this globalization, the school was given a name with an English foundation: BRAZIL-021 SCHOOL OF JIU-JITSU, or BRA-021 for short.The Team is composed with schools in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro), United States and Canada.
Brazil-021 Mission

Brazil-021 School of Jiu-Jitsu seeks much more than winning competition medals.

Our resolution is to promote health, well-being, self-confidence, and mental toughness in a safe,
encouraging, and inspirational environment to properly prepare our clients for all of the challenges of life.
Ultimately, we strive for the children of our current students to become our future students.
Family Friendly, and Family First
We believe that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is for everybody, and should be accessible to anybody who is interested. We believe in creating a family-friendly environment that is appropriate for students of all ages. We also believe that family should always come first, and emphasize family values between team members in order to develop trust and genuine camaraderie.
What differentiates Brazil-021 from other schools

• Besides offering the highest level of Jiu-Jitsu, fundamentally we stress and follow the philosophy of JiuJitsu as a martial art (and not as a sport);
• Focus on respect within the hierarchy;
• Principles, teaming, etiquette, drive are more valued than a medal
• Services are also geared towards competitors and developing champions;
• All members of Brazil 021 help our competitors to achieve through support, training, representation at events;
• Special high intensity training classes geared towards competition;
• Education on mental toughness and discipline required to succeed in competition;
• We seek to promote Jiu-Jitsu as an individual life style through physical activity in a balanced manner.";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/06502113acfaf3b7cde4b41b7a40635f?AccessKeyId=1BDB911188E3C39AEB87&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://www.brazil021chicago.com/programs.html";"Brazil-021

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes stand out as a great option if you are looking to challenge your child's mind and body in a way that keeps them excited and engaged.  At Movimento we are passionate about our personal approach to kids’ jiu jitsu classes. While many kids’ martial arts involve repetitive, static poses, we believe that the best training is done through patient instruction and carefully observed, dynamic partner work.

Unlike striking arts, such as karate and taekwondo, jiu jitsu uses leverage and body position to throw, sweep, pin, and submit opponents—regardless of their size or strength. This means that while little ones won’t be breaking any boards, the self-defense skills they do learn will be immediately applicable. As they progress, through perseverance and plenty of encouragement, kids will develop a strong sense of self-confidence, discipline, and a healthy respect for others.

Classes are designed for kids as young as 7 and require a traditional uniform, called a gi. This encourages the use of highly refined techniques, thoughtful strategies, and careful control. Each class begins with a warm-up, including cardio exercises and fun games. From there we move on to a daily technique, and finish with live sparring. Under a qualified instructor’s constant supervision, kids will be able to apply what they’ve learned in spirited matches with fellow classmates. Passion, respect, and inspiration drive us in our personal martial-arts pursuits, and we strive every day to pass those on to each of our students.";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay Thai Kickboxing";"https://www.movimentobjj.com/schedule-and-pricing";"https://www.movimentobjj.com/schedule-and-pricing";"Monday: 4:15 PM - 9:00 PM

The Academy originally operated out of an 800 square foot facility with a little mat space, a desk, a small locker room and lots of blood, sweat and tears. Over the last 7 years, we have trained hundreds of students, many of whom were visiting Chicago and needed a great place to train. On any given day, one may see a well known competitor in both Jiu Jitsu and MMA at RIO Jiu Jitsu. These athletes can choose to train anywhere while visiting Chicago, but they choose RIO Jiu Jitsu Academy. People did not go out of their way to train at the original facility for its amenities; they came because of our head instructor Pete “the Greek” and his great team of students. In the Jiu Jitsu world, Pete is known for his no non-sense approach to training and passes on his knowledge to his students. Therefore, anyone who has the desire to learn authentic Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and comes to Rio Jiu Jitsu to train will get better.

In a few years the school out grew its original space, but the training was so exciting, intense, informative and fun, that Pete’s students were willing to overlook the limited space of the original Academy.

After seven awesome years, RIO Jiu Jitsu Academy finally has a facility that is worthy of its excellence. The new facility is over 5,000 square feet, with over 3,000 square feet of mat space. The mats are situated over a custom floor for added comfort, safety and speed. In addition, the gym has custom heavy bags of different shapes and sizes in addition to takedown dummies, striking shields, cardio vascular machines and so forth. If want to challenge yourself, regardless of your current level, then RIO Jiu Jitsu will become your new home. Equipped with men’s and women’s changing rooms, showers, a viewing area for family and friends and plenty of parking, the Academy is sure to become one of Chicago’s gems and a permanent part of its business landscape.";"https://res.cloudinary.com/display97/image/upload/q_auto,fl_lossy,f_auto/h_100/25029.png";"http://riojj.com/classes/Kids-Martial-Arts";"RIO's Kids Martial Arts, Jiu Jitsu and Bully Proof program will help your child mature into an emotionally and physically strong, capable, responsible adult.

Beginner Women's Self Defense Seminars Classes Enrolling In March

When it comes to protecting yourself and loved ones, Jiu Jitsu is equally effective for both men and women. In this day and age, people must stay alert and be prepared to defend themselves on a moment's notice. The good news is that RIO Jiu Jitsu has a special Self-Defense program for women only.

Although women may not typically be able to match men physically, those who know how to utilize effective fighting techniques that rely on leverage and proper body mechanics, as opposed to brute force, will be able to overcome larger and stronger individuals.

While many personal protection devices such as pepper spray, stun guns and so on are available, the best way to cope with life's threats is to develop killer instinct, grace under pressure and confidence that people notice. The most important self-defense technique is recognizing danger and avoiding it. It is also critical to appear alert, healthy and confident, to avoid appearing vulnerable. Training at RIO Jiu Jitsu Academy instills true and well deserved confidence in those eager to learn. Take control of your self-confidence and learn to unlock the power of your body and mind at RIO Jiu Jitsu Academy.
Why Our Program Works For Women

We teach realistic martial arts training appropriate for any gender but tailored specifically for women. What we do not teach is nonsense or self-delusion. Our program is designed to use intellect coupled with proper body mechanics and knowledge of the human body to control dangerous situations and survive.

We are also aware that safety is critical to sound training and have equipped the gym with all of the best safety features.

Women will learn techniques that are both simple to learn, devastatingly effective and specifically designed for women.

Our program focuses on developing muscle memory so that the skills you practice in class will become second nature (i.e. they will happen automatically, if you are ever required to protect yourself). We give you the tools to successfully cope with attacks anytime, anywhere without hesitation.

That's not all! Women learn much more than self defense when they join our program. Our female members are better equipped to face all challenges of life, tackle every kind of difficult situation and enjoy a better life generally.
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS!

Besides learning Self Defense Techniques... we assure that you will:

(BJJ, Self-Defense)

TDC MMA + Fitness is proud to offer an anti-bullying BJJ kids program. We teach kids discipline and self-defense in an encouraging, energetic, inclusive environment. Our program was created to help encourage kids and give them confidence in any situation. Our kids program is great for kids of all ages.

The program is developed around Brazilian Jiu Jitsu teaching your kids how to defend themselves from bullying and from dangerous situations where they may need to defend themselves. With BJJ, you can defend yourself from much larger assailants.

If a child wants to learn jiu-jitsu in a non-competitive way with no tournaments, then that is entirely up to the child and we will be happy to assist them in anyway.

The program is for children between the ages of 5 and 16 years old and offers a safe, fun and challenging environment that educates our students on self-defense, fitness principles and bullying prevention. This program is taught by  world class instructor, owner of Lionize, Mike Nagy.   The youth belt promotion program is built around safety, respect and education.

Lionize Training Centers unique belt promotion provides our students with the opportunity to advance with determination and commitment.   However, having fun is a must! 
What to Expect

Each child will be given a white belt and asked to wear it to each 50 minute class. The program consists of 8 levels broken down by a variety of skill, technique, agility and endurance. The program has been carefully constructed to align each level within a variety of age levels. We feel that it’s important to reward and recognize our students as they continue to grow as an adolescent and as an athlete. Lionize promises:

    Respect, communication and teamwork among their peers and their elders.
    Conditioning and strength towards additional sports
    Increased endurance, strength and flexibility
    Improvement with their study skills and increased mental focus

LIONIZE TRAINING CENTER’S YOUTH KICKBOXING PROGRAM goes far beyond fitness, it lays the foundation for a successful future.
Class Breakdown

    Warm Up. Calisthenics and Stretching to loosen up the muscles for exercise
    Technique Training. Fundamental techniques for boxing and kickboxing
    Partner Drills. Kids will be paired with fellow students to practice techniques on pads and bags
    Cool Down & Games: Technique based games such as football, dodgeball and tag

Students will be tested privately when the professors have identified that they are ready to be recognized with a stripe on their belt. (Meaning, no student will be tested unless the professor is certain they are ready to advance to the next level. Lionize Training Center takes pride that the youth kickboxing program has a no failing in our policy.)   Testing will take place 3 times per year on a weekend afternoon where all families are welcome to watch and recognize the promotion of their child. Class levels will remain combined for now as we are qualified to differentiate between each level and can continually support the growing needs of each student.
Lionize Training Centers first priority is for our students to accept that everyone is equal and that having fun is a must. Participating in a martial arts program has incredible scientific evidence showing it helps in all areas of a child’s life, especially school. We are extremely excited to offer this support and program for your child.

I’m talking about the self-confidence it takes to raise your hand in school (when you just don’t ‘get it’)… I’m talking about the self-discipline to do what you have to do (whether you like it or not – like “study” before “fun”) …. And, of course I’m talking about owning the personal self-esteem that it takes to assert yourself; to lead others; and, ultimately …. to be responsible for your own choices… good or bad.” That’s “true success.”

Now most parents think these things “take time”… but my program, at U.S. Elite Martial Arts, can actually give your child the mental tools – that will make them bullyproof, confident, respectful and responsible right NOW! They will have the skills like:

    Harness The Power Of Laser Like Focus! She’ll be able to block out distractions almost at will.
    Stand Up For Himself Without Being Abusive or Offensive! Sending off a powerful yet subtle “vibe” that displays confidence and assertiveness.
    Better Grades and Better Friends. Nothing raises grades more than a child who is confident and has a high level of self esteem.

    Own the speed, coordination, and agility that it takes to enjoy sports, gym class or recess. Now, your child will never get “picked last” because of her new found mastery of motor skills.

That is the key benefit to training in the Martial Arts that will lead to so many wonderful things in your child’s life.  From making new friends, asking the girl to prom, or walking into their boss’s office to ask for a raise are just some of the situations that your child will eventually find themselves in as they grow up to be teenagers and adults.  Having the self-confidence to take action as well as to not take action, is learned on the mats.

Let’s talk about bullies.  They are everywhere: from the playground to the boardroom.  Training in the Martial Arts doesn’t encourage your child to PHYSICALLY FIGHT the bully, but rather instill the confidence in your child that they DO NOT have to fight.  While your child will be taught the techniques that are designed to keep them safe, they are also being taught to use their voice, rather than their fists to defuse the situation.

Having the knowledge that they have the ability to protect themselves and their friends from a bully gives your child more confidence to speak to the bully; to fight fire with water.

Many parents are concerned that if they were to enroll their child in a martial arts program that they will become more aggressive and start picking fights.  The opposite is actually true.  When children study the martial arts, through developing self-discipline and learning respect, both for themselves and others, kids become less aggressive and are more likely to talk logically or walk away if confronted with a negative situation.

Like the exchange between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi in the original ‘Karate Kid’:
Daniel:  You train to fight.
Miyagi: That what you think?
Daniel: [pondering] No.
Miyagi: Then why train?
Daniel: [thinks] So I won’t have to fight.
Miyagi: [laughs] Miyagi have hope for you.

Kids who train in the Martial Arts become more assertive and less aggressive. Just like Adults, if they have a healthy outlet for their energy, they will let go of stress and frustrations.

Perhaps the best spokesperson for jiu jitsu is Ciao Terra who trains in California. Ciao is a very accomplished jiu jitsu fighter, but his journey in jiu jitsu began when his mother enrolled him into classes because he was severely bullied when he was young and used jiu jitsu as a method for improving his life. Listen to him speak about his jiu jitsu journey.

Other benefits of training in the martial arts:

    Greater academic achievement
    Unshakable self respect
    Increased strength and fitness, in both body and mind
    Fearless self-confidence
    Awesome self-control
    Unshakable self-esteem

Demian states that, “Jiu-jitsu gives people an option to tap or submit. The intention is not to hurt or punish the opponent. They are given a choice to stop that.

Kids confident in their ability to defend themselves are more likely to stand up for themselves, should they be bullied. In most cases, standing up for themselves diffuses the situation without any further action. Also confident kids do not bully other kids, as they have nothing to prove.
We create an environment that keeps the children enthused about learning, and while we emphasize attention to detail, we also make it fun. So while having fun, your child will be learning the most effective system for self-defense, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ). BJJ is one of the world’s fastest growing sports, so your child will have the opportunity to train and compete in local and national level competitions, if you so choose.

BELT TESTING AND ADVANCEMENT

Your student will be evaluated, and will progress through the child ranks of the International Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation (IBJJF).  The children’s belt system progresses through white belt, to a series of grey, yellow, orange and green belts.  After the student reaches the final level in the green belt, and they reach the age of 16, they will progress to the adult belts of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
We use the belt system to show student progress, and give the student a goal to work towards.  As an academy, we take great pride in our ranking system and belts are not given, they are earned on the mat with hard work and dedication.

If you have any questions about the program, feel free to ask an instructor.  We are here for you, and want you and your child to feel at home in the academy and with the staff.

Thank you and we will see you on the mat!";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://markturnerbjj.com/membership-pricing/";"http://markturnerbjj.com/schedule-2/";"Monday: 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM

What Are The Benefits of Youth Wrestling?
* Wrestling is an amazing sport that teaches discipline and builds character.
* Wrestling provides a positive outlet for especially energetic boys and girls.
* Wrestling is an individual sport, but also has a team component, and still teaches teamwork and the importance of working together.
* It is one of the few sports where a child’s foot speed, ball-handling skills, hand-eye coordination, and size do not matter. There is room for everyone and wrestlers only compete against others in a similar weight class.
* Wrestling is an amazing way to stay in shape. Your child will benefit from the strength & cardio demand of wrestling while getting in shape in a safe and fun environment.

WRESTLING MYTHS
Myth: Wrestling is unsafe
Wrestling rules are very clear on safety. Illegal moves and potentially dangerous situations can result in penalty points and even disqualification. Coaches and referees work very hard to keep wrestling safe for all participants.

Myth: Wrestling is a brute sport
Wrestling is not a sport that demands brute strength. Technique and conditioning are more important to succeed in wrestling than the ability to push someone around the mat.

The Fusion Fitness MMA Kids programs focuses on the physical and mental aspects of the student’s training. Our classes promote confidence and self-esteem, encourage social relationships, and enhance your child’s physical well-being by laying a foundation that stresses the importance of exercise and self-motivation. Aspects such as self-confidence, modesty, courtesy, focus and teamwork are core principles that are focused upon in kids programs, along with a solid emphasis on the fundamental martial arts skills and techniques.

The Fundamentals of martial arts are instilled upon the students from the beginning, along with a structured environment that encourages and praises those who work hard, show respect and follow instructions. We have adopted a color-coded rank system for our children’s programs in order help breakdown the techniques to ensure that the quality of development remains world class. Our rank system has proven itself since first being implemented, producing technically high-level students who greatly understand and respect the importance of what they are learning. Our kids program is designed for children generally between the ages of 7-12 years old. However, some children remain enrolled in it through the age of 13. Those who are at a higher aptitude of learning or skill level at the age of 13 can move into the adult programs.
Jr Thai Boxing (Ages 7-12)

Derived primarily from the national sport of Thailand our Jr Thai Boxing program is a fun action packed class for kids to learn this great martial art in a fun and controlled environment. This program has been adapted to maximize the effectiveness of this martial art for children.
Gracie Bullyproof® Jr Grapplers (Ages 8-13)

In the Gracie Bullyproof program, we focus on 33 non-violent self-defense techniques that teach children to “neutralize and negotiate” with the bullies. Most martial arts programs rely on striking the attacker with punches and kicks. This strategy can often make the situation worse, or be completely ineffective against a larger, stronger, more aggressive opponent. In the Gracie Bullyproof program we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. In fact, numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one.";"N/A";"N/A";"Thai Boxing, MMA";"N/A";"Schedule available after signup!";"Monday: 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM, 4:00 PM - 8:30 PM

When an athlete has trained since childhood in activity he or she loves, there is very little that can hold him or her back. We know that firsthand. It required a high degree of physical and mental commitment to compete on the US National Team at an elite level, but collectively, we have many championships under our belts. From winning multiple World Championships, to taking home golds at the Pan American Games, to coming out of retirement to vie for Olympic gold in 2020, we believe there is no challenge too daunting to face. For us, however, it has never been about the medals or the titles, but rather the sense of personal fulfillment at knowing that we had given our best. We have demonstrated through hard work and perseverance you can accomplish your goals and achieve a high level of personal satisfaction that is more valuable than any material reward or public acclaim.

The enjoyment of karate training and competition has given us a passion for life and enabled us to travel and form strong friendships with people all over the world. We have also been particularly blessed, having met each other through karate. Together, with our amazing staff, we have built an organization that is inclusive and welcoming of everyone, and has provided people with the opportunity to push past their limits and discover that champion within. By training and sweating with people of all different races, religions, cultures, and economic backgrounds, karate students form strong bonds of friendship and mutual respect. Karate breaks down all barriers and is truly a wonderful, life-changing experience.

Karate allows every person to participate at their own level in a comfortable and accepting environment. Although karate is highly anaerobic with very explosive movements, it is an activity that one can pick up at any stage of his or her life and practice for a lifetime. There are a wide range of physical benefits from martial arts training at every age, including improvement in flexibility, muscular strength and endurance, balance, and coordination. In a class environment, a good instructor keeps students motivated and encourages them to establish and achieve their goals, which often come in the way of rank advancement. At FMA, we have had many adults comment on the positive impact that karate has had on them and their families. For example, one father became emotional when he told us that he was able to ski with his family for the first time in many years, as karate training had helped him to lose weight and become healthy enough for it.

So what’s stopping you from doing karate? It may seem like something foreign or an activity you might not see yourself doing, but once you start, it becomes infectious. There are so many aspects of karate training that you can focus on. Some people love the history and philosophy of the art, while others enjoy the physical and mental strength that it builds. Some prefer the self-defense aspects and combative side of this martial art, while others simply want to share a fun activity with their friends and family. There is something for everybody in karate training, regardless of age. We have students who are three years old and students who are 73 – and they are equally excited when they accomplish their goal and achieve their next rank.";"https://scontent.fdac2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/17757471_1328934660523529_2895422477680807912_n.jpg?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeHg_7_aJkfgECrsPKtx5xkyK4bIMyDy-C6D-MRGT5LtDjJG2i7fsU5_0qzhuKw4mVbXYTs0g50eeUU-E1ojgq-dHQTps3M__aK7FUNMU8ZqsQ&oh=5a9d71a8d78fda105fef545d7d655207&oe=5B0235B7";"http://www.fonsecamartialarts.com/karatetots/";"The Karate Tots program is designed for ages 3 to 4, crucial years in a child’s development.

Based in Fort Wayne, IN, Brandon traveled to Corral’s Martial Arts (120 miles) on a monthly basis to train with Braulio Corral, bringing his younger brothers Mike and Chris as often as possible. Between visits, Brandon and his brothers committed themselves to practicing their jiu jitsu on a daily basis, inside of their dad’s garage.

For nearly a year, Brandon, Chris, Mike, and their older brother Randy Jr. prepared each other for competition; grappling on carpet — maintaining their discipline in shuai jiao and progressing in BJJ. They trained nightly and were not open to the public.

In mid 2006, when the Lees finally acquired wrestling mats, they invited a friend, Anthony Lapsley, to come train. The bond between the Lee’s and Lapsley was instantaneous. Because Brandon (20) had no interest in opening an academy of his own, he and his brothers began to share time with Lapsley at the Dragon’s Den (Mike and Kristy Bowersock).

By late 2006, as many as a dozen people were training in the Lee garage, at least three times a week. At this point, it was apparent that an academy was inevitable, so the brothers (with the help of their “uncle” Johnny) moved out of their dad’s garage and into their first location on the south side of Fort Wayne. The name of the academy was Fort Wayne Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (2007-2011).

From the time that Brandon was a blue belt, he was coaching students primarily to get them to a level where they could become his training partners. In the process of training students, Brandon’s passion for competition shifted to a passion for teaching. Likewise, his passion for MMA shifted to a passion for BJJ.

During this time, the brothers continued to train Lapsley in preparation for fights; just as they continued to travel as often as possible to train with Braulio Corral.

In late 2011, after a time of personal crisis, Brandon leaned into his brothers and felt moved to rebrand the academy to reflect the power of brotherhood, and to carry his family’s name. The academy broadened its scope to begin to more intentionally engage BJJ within the context of MMA, and to honor their foundations in Shuai Joao wrestling. It was named Lee Brothers Submission Academy (2011-2017).

With an expanding school, the brothers worked out a deal with their pastor (Tom Foster) to train in the gym of the church (Liquid) where they had become very involved. In 2012 Brandon Lee received his brown belt under Corral. The academy remained at the church until late summer 2014; continuing to grow in the discipline off BJJ and expanding its fighters program to accommodate talented pro fighters like Evan DeLong, Nick Kraus, Darby Halferty, David Oviatt, and Jordan Downey.

With a growing roster of a dozen pro and amateur fighters, it was time for the Lees to move out of their church. In August of 2014, the Lee brothers opened shop at their current location (5015 Speedway Drive).

In July of 2015, the the Lee brothers were devastated when their father (63) Randy Lee passed away. Over the next year, the gym felt the strain of the loss. The doors stayed open because of the loyal and passionate community of members, but the brothers fell out of touch with Braulio Corral. By the summer of 2016, although the fight roster had swelled north of fifteen athletes — Brandon, Chris, and Mike knew that if they were going to remain healthy while serving their team, they would need to change directions.

They turned back to their “uncle” Johnny and began a process of vision-casting over the next year. With Brandon working long hours to provide for his family, Mike and Chris stepped up as head BJJ coaches, as four-stripe purple belts of 5 years. It was clear by this point that the future of the academy existed in the dreams of its fighters. So the Lee Brothers, alongside of their uncle, put their focus toward more consistent service for the development of the fight team.

In the fall of 2017, the academy (Lee Brothers Submission Academy) officially rebranded to Lee Brothers MMA. The rebrand sparked a monumental boom for Lee Brothers, to such a measure that that they found themselves scrambling to keep up with the volume of their students, and the schedule of their competition team. Therein, the brothers began to recommit their students to the basics, firming their foundations in the arts.

Around this time, the Lee brothers were introduced to (BJJ blackbelt) Maykon Barradas. The brothers felt immediately connected to Barradas; sharing striking similarities in their BJJ journeys.  They continued building a friendship with him, and over coffee in February of 2018, the brothers asked Barradas to coach them forward in their Brazilian Jiu Jitsu journey.";"https://scontent.fdac2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/21314591_1483210348425295_6140497168077613706_n.jpg?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeHFrFD_wUcBJXK9dZTyQI-4MDuAb-nvyu0g8JOMqxsz0L1X6RIi0qkcEVGhkluy5ufpQYS08PKIyXOc4N71LlGuGfsdggN4fdlfxwriU-t-Zg&oh=cb7fa69b20b6e703601125e8f2708965&oe=5B4DDFD4";"http://www.leebrothersmma.com/mma-for-kids/";"If you are looking for a place to help your kid be awesome and learn basic boxing and submission wrestling, this is the place for you.

Fight Hub Headquarters is the ONLY place for Kids Mixed Martial Arts in Indianapolis!

The popularity of Martial Arts will never diminish, may be it will change some of its form in the coming times. The Traditional Martial Arts have paved way for Mixed Martial Art and the kids are the most fascinated lot. After watching The Karate Kid, many kids have started dreaming to be one! Believe me there is nothing wrong in it and as a parent you should encourage the kid to be a martial artist. There are many benefits for kids’ training in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).

The Fight Hub HQ is the ONLY Academy in Central Indiana to offer Kids Mixed Martial Arts classes.

Some of the benefits of kids mixed martial arts in Indianapolis at the Fight Hub HQ include:

    Molding one’s character: The Mixed Martial Arts trains the learner to be humble, patient and hardworking. They can’t learn the techniques of Mixed Martial Arts unless they possess or develop these qualities. Once learned, these moral qualities would remain with the kid forever and thus mold his character in a better way.

    Teaching self defense: There are many cases of bullying and even rage in school and classrooms. Kids Mixed Martial Arts help them become adept in self defense which help them against bullying and may be any attack. These arts teach them to defeat the attacker without using any weapon.

    Improving self confidence: The self confidence of the kids is boosted when they learn Mixed Martial Arts. Especially the shy and less active children are highly benefited by learning MMA. They start taking part in the group activities and recitations. This makes them popular in the school. The MMA training also make them natural leaders and they have a fan following them.

    Utilizing free time in a better way: The kids are able to utilize their free time gainfully by joining a Mixed Martial Arts academy. It also improves their gregariousness and friendship. The kids who were aloof before joining MMA training instantly became more involved in group activities.

    Helping children with ADD: As kids Mixed Martial Arts classes have a structured training program, the kids with attention deficit disorder (ADD), hyperactivity and learning difficulties are highly benefited.

It will enable you to perform simple effective escape techniques, and will remove ones feeling of helplessness.  Our techniques will provide you with the skills and knowledge to escape from an attacker, whether you are standing on your feet or on the ground.  The escape moves are based on leverage and technique and do not require strength, speed or coordination.  Our self-defense techniques are unique as they do not rely exclusively on striking, as other martial arts.  Striking based techniques are not effective against a bigger, stronger person, and are useless on the ground, which is where you may end up when being attacked.

Women's self-defense classes are taught by request at the academy for individuals, or in small groups, or we can host a one time seminar for your larger group or organization.

Having trained in a number of different disciplines of martial arts since the age of 13, Jack has dedicated his life to teaching others and helping each person maximize his or her own unique skills and attributes so that his art works for them — on an individual basis.

On a professional level, Jack is a 3rd degree Black Belt in the art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under legendary instructor Wellington “Megaton” Dias.  Jack is also certified by the International Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation (IBJJF).  Jack has been actively competing in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for 20 years. He is 2013 World Jiu-Jitsu Champion.  At black belt level, he is a 5x Pan Jiu Jitsu Champion, 4x European Open Champion, 6x World No Gi Jiu Jitsu Champion, and 2x European No Gi Champion.

In addition to BJJ, Jack is also certified in Bruce Lee’s art of Jeet Kune Do and Filipino Martial Arts (Kali) under legendary instructors Dan Inosanto and Paul Vunak.  Jack still considers himself a student of martial arts.  That helps to keep his passion alive for his students.

Although Jack hones his skills by competing in tournaments, his strength and true passion is teaching others. While many martial arts instructors hold various jobs during the week and teach only in the evening or weekends, Jack makes his living teaching others. It is all he does, and it shows in his students –many of whom have won Jiu Jitsu Championships and Mixed Martial Arts belts.";"http://jackmcvicker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/logo1.gif";"http://jackmcvicker.com/programs/kids-programs/";"At McVicker’s Martial Arts Academy, experienced and dedicated instructors teach children effective self-defense skills based upon the martial arts of  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Children also learn non-violent conflict resolution skills and bully- prevention tactics along with positive character traits that will help them to achieve in other areas of their lives. We offer classes that are fun and high-energy, providing exercise and motivation for children to lead healthy lifestyles.
Benefits of the McVicker’s Martial Arts Academy Kids Program
Effective Self-Defense Skills

In a fun and safe environment, we teach children how to protect themselves in the face of danger using effective Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques. Our instructors help children develop into confident young adults who are able to discern right from wrong; know when to stand their ground, and; when to “yell, run and tell.” We practice how to avoid dangerous situations using our words and how to escape a wide range of attacks.
Character Development

McVicker’s Martial Arts Instructors incorporate core martial arts values, including respect, focus, discipline, teamwork, and integrity, into each lesson. We’ve integrated an innovative merit badge system that represents these core values and others. By earning their badges students build self-esteem through overcoming challenges to achieve their goals.  Teaching children important life skills is a team effort and we make sure to work closely with families. We’ve created take- home material for parents and guardians to help enforce what their children learn on the mat.
Exercise and Healthy Living

Many children in the United States are overweight and at risk of health challenges that are preventable. Our kids program promotes a healthy lifestyle, providing an alternative to television and video games. We increase children’s endurance as well as strengthen muscles, all while they are having fun and learning valuable life skills that they will carry with them as adults. Fun! At McVicker’s Martial Arts Academy, we understand that kids need to have fun when learning the martial arts. This is why our core curriculum includes a variety of high- energy practice drills and skill-building games. In general, our kids’ classes run longer than usual because we use games as a reward for good behavior on and off the mat.

Mission
Our mission is to teach children effective martial arts and to provide a safe, supportive, and structured environment in which children thrive.

Philosophy

Every child can benefit from training in the martial arts. The focus, self- discipline, and respect that students learn from training in the martial arts empower them to become better students and to become positive, productive members of our community. It takes a village to raise a child. Collaboration with teachers, families and local community organizations is imperative to developing well- rounded, positive, and civically engaged martial artists equipped with the confidence and skills needed to succeed.  For more info on our Kids Program and what McVicker’s Martial Arts has to offer, check out our FAQs page.";"N/A";"N/A";"MMA";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Jack McVicker";"Free introductory class offer with SignUp!";"jack.m@live.com";"https://web.facebook.com/McVickerBJJ/";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Yes";

At Soma Jiu-Jitsu of Kokomo we are dedicated to teaching the principles of Helio Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and preserving the integrity of the Martial Art, on and off of the mat. 

The mission of the academy is to provide quality instruction to our students through effective, real world self-defense techniques that are not based on size, strength, athletic ability or time limits.  These techniques were proven as one of the most effective forms of self-defense in the first MMA competition in the United States during UFC 1 (wikipedia link) in 1993.  Jiu-Jitsu is also one of the earliest forms of exercise or physical fitness in existence, providing for a complete workout of the body and mind.

At Soma Jiu-Jitsu of Kokomo, we are committed to improving the lives of our students and spreading the educational and moral benefits of the art.  Each class is taught in the traditional white gi (uniform).

The major skills we work on are: focus, teamwork, control, balance, memory, discipline, fitness and coordination. All of these skill sets are learned while having fun and playing games.

Each class we learn common techniques in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu while playing games with other students. All skills are taught in a safe, supervised environment.

** Try-outs of classes and visitors to watch a class must be scheduled in advance by messaging us on Facebook or at info@iowabjj.com **

Ages

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a great art for children as early as the age of 8. This is an age in which children show enough maturity to listen attentively and respond to directions.

We separate children into age specific groups to allow us to teach the older kids more advanced techniques without teaching it to the younger children who may not understand the risks of applying the advanced techniques.

We allow children as old as 14 years old. Due to the differing sizes of children as they grow it is hard to have a firm age.

As children outgrow the kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu program, they are invited to participate in the adult program. We continue to charge kids BJJ prices until the child reaches 15 years of age (unless a part of a family membership).
Rules

Class Rules:

    Respect all other students, parents and instructors.
    No hitting ANYONE in anger.
    Competition is how we learn. Winning or losing is not emphasized, doing your best is.
    There is NO CRYING in Jiu-Jitsu. If you get hurt, rub it on the mat, it will feel better.
    Parents are welcome and encouraged to stay and watch class.

Safety

 

Due to the nature of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, we emphasize safety in every class. We feel so strongly about safety that we have a safety word that we share with parents and students in almost every class. That safety word is FREEZE.

When ANYONE in the class witnesses a potentially unsafe condition, they yell FREEZE. The children should all respond by stopping and raising one hand in the air. This should prevent the situation from going from bad to worse.
Uniform

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu's uniform is called a GI. It is a heavy uniform that provides handles for both classmates. The gi makes throws and control of your opponent much easier. Because the gi's can be a little rough on the inside, we suggest that all kids either wear a rash guard (explained later) or t-shirt under their gi until they get used to wearing the gi.

We will primarily be teaching the kids class in gi's. But we do occasionally have classes where we will teach with no-gi. On those days, we prefer to have the kids wearing rash guard/t-shirts and long sweats.

Rash Guard - A rash guard is what most people refer to as Under Armor. It is made from a material which wicks sweat away from the body. It also provides a great barrier between the gi and and children's sensitive skin. Most of the adult members have some form of rash guard and it helps tremendously.";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay Thai";"N/A";"http://iowabjj.com/schedule/";"Monday: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, 5:45 PM - 8:00 PM

    From Age 5 To 14 (MMA Fitness)";"http://brassboxing.com/blog/69711/women-should-be-in-Jiu-Jitsu-without-it-you-may-suffocate-";"One of the things I remember most about my first few Jiu Jitsu classes is the feeling of suffocation.  Jiu Jitsu is essentially learning to fight on the ground making it a phenomenal self defense training opportunity.  To someone who knows nothing of this life changing sport, it looks a lot like wrestling.  It puts people in your personal space.  Your hot, tired and the feeling of panic creeps in as someone tries to hold you down.  When I was in class I would often feel as though a blanket was over my head when my opponent was closer than 18 inches.   Now, what if your in a dangerous situation?  Can you imagine the fear one would endure? The panic and a feeling of suffocation setting in as someone you don't know is in your personal space and your not in a safe controlled environment.  It's difficult to think about.  The amazing thing about Jiu Jitsu is the way it conditions you brain.  Part of this art in particular is learning to stay calm under pressure. Learning to find a breathing hole where there seemingly is none.  Learning slow your heart rate in a desperate situation or feeling of defeat.
There are possibly infinite number of reasons women should be in Jiu Jitsu and we'll touch on more next time.  For now, I just want to drive home the idea that you don't want the first time someone is in your personal space to be the first time you have to defend yourself.  Don't send your daughters off to college with little to no body awareness.  Learning to protect yourself is so empowering, it changes the core of your being.

 Learn more about our overall program philosophy and specifics individual programs below.

Martial arts instill respect, discipline, work ethic, and social cooperation in kids. Contrary to the myth that martial arts training teaches children violence, children with martial arts training have been found to resolve differences more effectively, to manage anger and frustration in more constructive ways, to have a much healthier self esteem, and other life skills. Additionally, children do learn skills to stay safe in volatile and potentially violent situations.

Below is information about each of our three kids programs, but always feel free to contact us for more information or to watch a class.

Kids’ Krav Maga
Based on the same principles in our adult Krav Maga program, kids learn the fundamentals of self-protection using elements of boxing, jiu jitsu, Muay Thai, and wrestling. Kids practice legitimate striking and grappling skills tailored towards self-protection rather than sport, teaching them to never view themselves as victims. Unfortunately, in today’s society, bullying is a major problem, and our kids Krav Maga program was designed to help combat that and other potential threats.

Kids’ Krav is taught by Nathan and Max Haddad and is available for kids age 8-12. It takes place Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:30-6:30 p.m. Participants need 10 or 12 oz boxing gloves, a rash guard, and sprawl shorts, all of which can be purchased at Core.

Kids’ Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
Our world-class BJJ program, led by Helio Soneca, has been specifically tailored toward kids ages 5-12. In these hour-long classes, boys and girls will learn everything from the basics of balance and developing a solid “base” to BJJ techniques such as sweeps, escapes, take downs, and submissions. In this program, progress is measured by ascending belt ranks, conforming to the Gracie Barra grading system of youth BJJ belts.

Kids’ BJJ is taught by Soneca and Nathan Haddad. For ages 5-7, classes are offered on Monday/Wednesday at 4:30-5pm. For kids ages 8-12, classes are offered Monday/Wednesday 5-6 pm and Saturday from 10-11 am. Participants must purchase a gi, which can be purchased at Core.

Kids’ Boxing
Legend Abdul Jarvis teaches kids (ages 8-12) striking essentials in this program. Kids practice marching stance drills, correct punching technique, punch numbers, basic footwork, and combinations. As the kids develop and instructors feel they are ready, kids can spar with appropriate protective gear if they want to. Kids usually love sparring, as it provides the ability to put into practice what they’ve learned and hone their combinations and footwork. Some kids also participate in local competition, and Core Kids always do well in these competitions.

Kids ages 8-12 can taking boxing class on Monday and Wednesday from 6-7 pm. Participants must wear 10 or 12 oz boxing gloves.";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay-Thai,Boxing";"N/A";"http://corelouisville.com/class-schedules/";"Monday: 10:00 AM - 9:00 PM

-Chewy

Brazilian Jiu jitsu stops bullies and develops work ethic

“My son Zachary started when he was 10 years old, he had no self confidence but all that changed when he met Chewy and the other instructors. They have helped mold him into the strong young man he has become. Zach is now 12 and in the 7th grade, he has the tools and self confidence to handle situations that may arise as they often do in middle school. All I can say is that thanks to Derby City I do not fear for my sons safety in school. The atmosphere at Derby City has been a very positive experience and I highly recommend it!” – Terri Schultz

What would you give to unplug your kids from their electronic devices? Would you rather see them spending time building self-esteem and skills that will help them move confidently in the world, as kids and well into adulthood?

Kids these days have a lot to deal with – the information age has made their world bigger and faster with more and more to deal with at alarmingly younger ages. Confident kids who have a great attitude, kids who are motivated and directed fair better in school. They lead more productive lives as adults thanks to skills learned early in life.

Does Your Child Deal with any of these Challenges?

    Being Bullied in School or Around the Neighborhood or Both
    Bad or Unpredictable Behavior and Moods
    A.D.D/A.D.H.D
    Grades that Don’t Reflect Their Intelligence and Ability
    Lacking in Social Skills – Could Use More Friends and Interact More Easily with Others
    Doesn’t Seem Motivated 
    Lacks Focus
    Lacks Confidence
    Experiences Low Self-Esteem
    Has Difficulty Dealing With Authority
    Is Overweight or Has Issues with Food

These are common problems many kids experience. Sitting in front of the TV playing video games or watching mindless programs, texting or spending hours on Facebook or other computer time-wasters doesn’t help. You want the best for your children and you lead a busy life. It’s hard to break your kids away from what all their peers are doing. It can be overwhelming at times.

I’m going to make you a bold promise.

At Derby City we help your kids develop self-confidence, get better grades, learn self-discipline and assist them in developing their unique potential. Let me get very specific:
In Our Martial Arts Program Your Child Will Gain…

You want your children to be safe and being able to defend themselves gives them confidence and puts your mind at ease. Our goal isn’t just to teach your kids how win a competition. They will know how to protect themselves should they ever be in a life threatening situation. It may sound dramatic, but this invaluable skill could save their life.

They also help develop balance, coordination and timing, which helps in sports and other activities. Feeling good about yourself physically leads to self-confidence and often, better health.

Leadership Skills: Learning to set goals and take responsibility for your actions helps your child succeed in every area of life. Your child will develop as a leader, instead of a follower. Learning how to cooperate benefits them and everyone they interact with. These are skills ensure that their success in school and carry right through to adult life. Foundational skills that last a lifetime begin right here with the personal attention and training they’ll get at Derby City.

Recently several of our female Brazilian Jiu-jitsu practitioners competed in an all female submission only tournament. Which is super cool. A submission only tournament is where the BJJ competitors roll with one another until one successfully achieves a hold of some sort. Choke hold, arm lock, leg lock, etc.

As a coach I’m very proud of all our or women and their courage to get out there and compete in the spotlight like they did. One of our BJJ Blue Belts was one of the competitors at the U.G.I All Female Submission Only No Gi grappling tournament.

Madison, who is known for being incredibly aggressive with top pressure along with having a strong college wrestling background played this match a little different than normal. During the Brazilian Jiu-jitsu / No Gi Grappling match. She used her top pressure to attack with an ankle lock instead of the grinding guard passing she usually does.

The match was a fast one and she was able to come away with the win during her women’s Brazilian Jiujitsu match. We’re super proud of her accomplishment.

If you are looking for a great martial arts school in the Louisville, Kentucky area, look no further than Louisville Martial Arts Academy.  [Instructor and child] We offer fun and exciting classes for ages five and up in a safe, family-oriented atmosphere. Whether you are looking for Karate, Kung-Fu, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), Kickboxing or weapons training, we have a great curriculum to accommodate the schedule and needs of your entire family. Whether you've never taken a martial arts class before or hold multiple black belts, Louisville Martial Arts Academy offers training at your skill level. Whether your goals are defending against schoolyard bullies, avoiding assault, training for MMA competition, or just getting into better shape and building confidence, we offer classes to meet your needs. We offer separate classes specifically for women, teens and children, so each student gets specific, relevant training. We would like to invite your family to come in and experience our martial arts programs for yourselves.  [Girl with sticks] You will get in shape, relieve stress, become more focused and energetic, gain confidence, and learn to continually improve yourselves.

We realize that there are many choices available to you and your family. You should choose wisely. Beware of the programs that offer a black belt in two years and promote based solely on attendance or time elapsed. This approach only provides students with a false sense of security. At Louisville Martial Arts Academy we offer a superior and ethical program that teaches the concepts and principles necessary to confidently defend yourself.

One of the things that sets LMAA apart is our commitment to providing genuine self defense skills to students of all ages.  [San Shou Throw] The programs at LMAA address self defense techniques for real-world situations. If you or your child must defend yourselves, then it is important to understand the different ranges of an encounter: weapons, striking, trapping and grappling. You will have the opportunity to study five different martial arts. Each style offers a different type of workout from the others and will make you a more well-rounded martial artist.

Students will learn to move with speed, power, and grace to effectively defeat attackers even if they are much larger or armed. Students will learn techniques that will allow them to use their opponent's energy against them and render them helpless without even throwing a punch. Students will also discover amazingly simple techniques which will allow them to disable their attacker using submission holds no matter their size.

In Fact, Let's Not Imagine. Let's Make It Happen, Together.

First, A Note From Our Instructor:
Hi, my name is Jason Church, owner of Church's Karate Academy in New Orleans, LA. I want to take a moment to welcome you to our website and to say THANK YOU for considering Martial Arts for your child. I've taught kids martial arts classes for years and as you can imagine, I've seen every kind of personality you can think of in a child. Rambunctious, shy, defiant, complacent...every child is different, with special gifts to give and challenges to overcome, and I've seen Martial Arts classes help every single one of them find their inner strength, peace, and focus. We've seen ultra-shy kids burst out of their shell, ADD and ADHD kids learn how to control themselves, socially awkward kids learn how to make and keep friends, and even helped special needs children find a place to fit in and feel accepted. So, what I'll do on this page is tell you a little about what our focus is in our classes, and what methods we use to achieve our results. Take a look at what we do, and see if our philosophy on the Martial Arts mat lines up with your goals as a parent, and if what we teach would be beneficial in your child's life. Again, THANK YOU for considering Martial Arts - it was literally the BEST thing that ever happened to me when I was young, and I think it's possible that it could be the same for your child.

School Pressure, Peer Pressure, Instilling Proper Values, Demanding Extra Curricular Activities
Sound Familiar?
I know what parents like you are facing. I've met thousands of parents just like you and I have to tell you, it's a tough time for kids these days.
Most parents I meet are dealing with these daily 21st Century demands as well as they can, but sometimes the signs of the pressure are obvious. When new students come into our school we often see:

Inability to Focus
It’s usually not malicious, they just have a really hard time focusing.
    
Crippling Shyness
Eyes on the floor, shoulders down, frozen in fear.
    
Difficulty Engaging with Peers or Authority Figures
Parents often see this as a lack of respect (It’s NOT! But it’s still important to overcome).
    
Lack of Follow Through or Perseverance
It’s really hard for a child to see past the “now” and keep at something consistently.
    
Lack of Motivation
It’s really hard to be a kid and have people telling you all day what to do. Some kids just shut down and lose their sense of personal motivation.
    
Low Fitness Levels
Childhood Obesity isn’t just a new buzzword. When iPads and Phones are a dime a dozen, getting kids to get off the couch and move is a real challenge.

t Can All Change
Within a Few Weeks, Parents Say They See Their Children Learn:

Increased Confidence
Confidence, especially in our Martial Arts classes, is the difference between what a child can actually do vs. what they think they can do. You’ll see them grow more and more confident, and confront new challenges both inside and outside of our school with a sense of drive and purpose.
    
The Ability to Defend Themselves Mentally, Emotionally AND Physically
If they ever need it, your child will absolutely be able to defend themselves physically. But far more importantly, they’ll be able to fend off the mental onslaught of peer pressure and the emotional weight of bullying and unkind behavior. These are things they’ll desperately need as they grow older.
    
Soaring Self Esteem
The most important thing your child will get in our classes is a tremendously positive sense of self. They’ll be able to objectively recognize things they need to improve (homework, family interaction, physical effort) without feeling hopeless, and they’ll take pride in the things they get right without discounting or minimizing their achievements. This will be invaluable for them as adults.
    
An Appreciation for Exercise
If you want kids to stay healthy, they have to enjoy their exercise. Our classes are so much fun, your child will beg to come. They’ll actually love doing pushups, jumping jacks and crunches. They’ll take pride in their improved flexibility and stamina, and they’ll leave class everyday sweating and smiling.

...But How?
How? The Answer isn’t rocket science, and honestly, We feel blessed to have discovered it. It's simple and subtle, but when you see it in person (especially as a parent) It’s almost Magical. ""The Answer"" solves every one of the issues we mentioned, and more.


Our Classes Are Specifically Designed for Kids
And That's Really Important
How children are treated and taught makes a huge difference in their experience, and therefore their ability. When they're engaged and excited, children learn really well. It seems obvious, but so often kids are ""forced"" to learn. At our school, they LOVE learning!


A ""Group Sport""
With An Individual Focus

Your child will interact with others, work with partners and listen to the instructor as a member of the group; but they'll never ""ride the bench"".  They'll be held to their own standard; no one else's. Every child is unique and our Martial Arts classes offer a fantastic opportunity to capitalize on their natural strengths to bolster their Self Esteem so that they have the emotional and mental capability to tackle areas that need work";"N/A";"N/A";"Kickboxing ";"N/A";"N/A";"Monday: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM

Classes are high energy and fast paced to ensure students remain focused and most of all have fun.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is especially well-suited as a youth martial art. Every child is unique in their stature, learning ability and physical characteristics. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) provides such a broad scope of techniques and movements that each child adopts only that which is effective for him/her without diminishing the effectiveness of their training. And with any martial arts discipline, common benefits of consistent training include:

    Increased concentration and focus
    Increased balance and coordination
    Increased conditioning, better health

Training also provides mental and emotional empowerment. Some of our kids challenge themselves in the arena of competition, tackling head-on the fear and anxiety leading up to the challenge and the challenge itself, making not only parents and coaches proud but also themselves. This is also true in today’s society where bullying has become pandemic. Some of these added benefits also include:

    Self-awareness
    Self-confidence
    Respect
    Teamwork
    Camaraderie

It's true that Little Ninja's activities will keep your child physically fit and that many of the group activities show children the benefits of good behavior. But, best of all, your child's class curriculum will also help them see the value of teamwork, good manners, and trying their best outside of the classroom. The main life skills that are taught in the Little Ninja's program are focus, memory, teamwork, discipline, self-control, fitness, balance, and coordination.

Many of the same concepts you are teaching your child at home will be consistently reinforced through classromm discussions in your child's programs. Topics such as: good manners(which include keeping hands and feet to themselves), respect for one's self and others, and following directions the first time and more!

Valuable personal development lessons have been built into the Little Ninja's curriculum. Your child will participate in discussions on ""Stranger Danger"", ""When to call 911' ""Fire Safety"", ""Street Safety"", and more.

Little Ninja's will improve your child's basic motor skills through basic martial skills such as falling safely, kicking, punching, and self-defense techniques. These skills will help your child enter society with a confident and enthusiastic outlook. Your child will become a better student in school, a better listener at home, and feel more ambitious towards his/hers future goals.

Let us enhance your child's mental and physical development in a fun, positive, and motivating way. Enroll your child today and help prepare them for life! Classes sizes are limited, call now to reserve your child's space. Parents, remember the Ninjas may train one or two days per week, so pick the most convenient day per week that fits your schedule.

On the mat your child will experience many challenges and obstacles that will connect with their outside environment and make them unstoppable when faced with difficulties in life.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is about efficiency. It’s about learning how to use your body in the best possible way – to take down any opponent of any size.

You’ll develop control over your entire body, so you can use your whole body weight to take down opponents.  That’s how Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighters go into matches against guys twice, even three times their size… and come out victorious.  In the battle of technique vs. brute force… technique always wins.  This is why we do believe that is the best martial art for any child!
Classes Include:

Fundamental BJJ
Mixed Martial Arts
Drills and Skills for BJJ Competition

Fundamental BJJ
In this class we will focus on the foundation of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. We will learn positioning, basic submission and basic concepts.  We will do this trough drilling, partner work and exciting games.

Ages 4-6

Our Little War Elephant Program is specially designed for 4 to 6 year-olds. There are 8 major skills that we focus on: Focus, Team Work, Control, Balance, Memory, Discipline, Fitness, and Coordination.    In each class, we cover one of these skills with a wide variety of activities that are fun, educational and at the same time gets your child physically fit.
Ages 7-12

Our War Elephant classes we start really diving in to the Stonecoast BJJ curriculum.  We will be doing a lot of partner work and drilling. These classes are design for any level of knowledge and ability.

Ages 12-16

Classes will be conducted in a manner that these kids will enjoy without any “little” kids and we will help in all aspects of the teen years. The years between 12 and 16 are very important for children. Any idea why? With high school around the corner, there are many challenges on the way. Here are some to name a few:

Physical: physical illness, acne, physical check-ups, weight worries, eating disorders, infections, height worries

Emotional: relationships, family problems, depression, violence issues

Social: bullying, tobacco and smoking, drugs, saying “no,”peer pressure, friend

Intellectual: nerd vs. popular dilemma, grades, college

It is very important that your child’s transition at this time is smooth because the choices they make during the high school years will have a lot of influence on what kind of adult they turn out to be. With right development, positive reinforcement, and good mentors, your child will be ready to be able to handle the difficult challenges of life ahead.";"N/A";"N/A";"Mixed Martial Arts";"N/A";"https://stonecoastbjj.com/calendar/";"Monday: 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM

We also know how imperative it is for any beginner to have the knowledge and skill to perform the basic movements that will help you in your journey through BJJ. Jay created the On Ramp program to help beginners understand the basic positions and body movements that will be seen throughout the curriculum. Our On Ramp program is a 4 week program, that meets twice a week (Monday and Wednesday at 5:30). It starts every first and third Monday of each month. 

The first two weeks you will be in a small group, set aside from our larger mat where the more advanced members attend class. You are submerged in the Academy atmosphere, but are given more private instruction by your own instructor. The last two weeks, your instructor will help integrate you into the classes and you will be paired with Academy gym members as you attend your first classes!

**We recommend starting with this program if you have no prior Jiu Jitsu experience.**

If learning something new in a group environment isn’t what you are looking for, and prefer a more one on one experience, we can set you up with one of our instructors upon request. Please send us an email and we will get you set up.

7 Reasons Why Martial Arts Is One Of The BEST Activities To Enroll Your Child In:

1. In an era of increased bullying, your child will learn how to avoid and effectively defend themselves in dangerous situations.

2. Your child will gain confidence in life which will help them to excel and succeed ineverything they take on.

3. Your child will learn respect. Respect is the first ingredient in child safety and behavior.

4. Martial Arts keeps your child active and helps them to develop a healthy/fit lifestyle.

5. Martial Arts is for everyone. It is not a team consisting of all the best athletes. No one sits on the bench.

6. Your child will learn Self-Control. Self-Control helps children to be patient and gentle in intense situations rather than angry and aggressive. This is an important aspect for handling any emergency situation!

7. There are so many ways Martial Arts can benefit your child and even your whole family. I could go on and on. The best way to find out is to bring them in and see for yourself!";"http://www.clinchacademy.com/womens-only-fitness/";"WOULD YOU PREFER A WOMEN'S ONLY FITNESS PROGRAM?

As a competitor in the1980’s and 1990’s, Master Bussard captured 18 Grand Championships and won hundreds of trophies. He holds a B.S. in Kinesiological Sciences from the University of Maryland, which helped him formulate and develop the various programs Kicks Karate now offers its students.

He is on a constant and never ending quest for improvement for himself, his students, his staff of talented instructors, and Kicks Karate.

Parents are encouraged to stay and watch the entire practice.";"http://columbia.groundcontrolusa.com/wcs3_class/ladies-jiu-jitsu/";"Ladies Program

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is without a doubt the best martial art for a lady to learn in order to defend herself from an attacker. Our ladies jiu-Jitsu techniques are based on leverage rather than strength and physical ability. It is one of the only martial arts where a woman that has been put on he back by a larger and stronger attacker still has the ability to defend herself.

Originally developed by the Gracie family, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu promotes the principle that a smaller and weaker person can successfully defend themselves against bigger and stronger opponents using leverage and proper technique.

Because of the obvious benefits for women, Ground Control has had many ladies that are interested in learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. However, one of the problems was that the classes tend to be made up of mostly men. Some women were not comfortable getting on the mats with strange men. We fixed that by starting a program that is women only.  This gives ladies the opportunity to begin learning the art in a much more comfortable environment.

The new student will spend their first few months of training learning the basic fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Building a good foundation is extremely important! Therefore, basic movement, position, and base will be the primary focus of the student at this stage of their training. Ground Control’s philosophy is that the students Jiu-Jitsu will only be as strong as the foundation that it is built upon in the beginning.

Students will experience results that go beyond gains in strength, flexibility, fitness or self-defense skills. By remaining truthful to the lessons learned in practice and applying them off the mats, Ground Control students experience an overall improvement on their focus, energy and general well-being.

The Ground Control Ladies Program teaches the basic principles of effective Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to the average woman while showing her how to use this in a real-life situation.

Benefit of Joining our Ladies Program:

    Learn the fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
    Increase focus, energy and concentration
    Enjoy significant gains in your overall fitness level
    Learn the GC Self-Defense System for women
    Become part of the GC Family
    Increase self-confidence
    Train at all 4 locations in Maryland
    Discounts to the school’s events and special classes
    Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is for anyone, including you!
    You will never forget your first class at Ground Control

What to Expect on the First Day:

We recommend you arrive 15 minutes before schedule, as the class will start on time. As your practice begins you will notice that the instructor has a precise plan for the class. While the techniques will change, the class routine is always similar so you know exactly what to expect during each part of practice. You will learn over 100 technique combinations in your first few months so be ready for the journey! You will also find strong support by the Ground Control team. Students with more experience are always there to help new members get started. By the end of class you’ll be physically tired but mentally exhilarated. Don’t get too exhausted, though–we hope to see you back the next day!

If you want to learn how to:
* avoid threatening situations
* respond to lower-level threats
* defend yourself against a wide variety of armed and unarmed attacks

come train with us. No prior experience is required. Individuals of all sizes and ages, including those with disabilities, train here - so can you!

In addition to learning to protect yourself, the way we train will increase your:
* endurance
* strength
* coordination
* cardiovascular fitness

We also offer youth classes, where our younger students develop situational awareness and learn the fundamentals of self-protection. Good values and character development are also an integral part of our training program.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c2.0.200.200/p200x200/1451484_10152057356096678_1582504056_n.jpg?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeGp2DJZA2PUGPfGWq_Z3h-8DwW9gOBwJ5SuCuPMFcpxsQGDQocAgeNM16J5LPtVwhT3UMm3elNn6AGlA7hUEk3QUV01Lm0WyVtooBuqNY4N3w&oh=feb0ace14f602b203487bd897586da98&oe=5B39759F";"http://www.combatju-jitsu.com/youth.htm";"
We respect the privacy of the children who train with us, and thus do not post pictures of the youth classes.
You are more than welcome to drop by and observe or have your child participate in a class,
and to discuss our program with the other parents.


Even in the youth (ages 6-13) classes, our students learn traditional jujitsu. We make the classes fun, but expect a certain level of focus and dedication from the students. Age is not necessarily an indicator, as each child is different; some students (of any age) have the focus, some do not.

The best way to find out is to bring your child and have them try a class! That way you and we can see how the child does, and mutually decide whether they're ready to join yet.

On the personal side, students in the youth classes learn:
respect for self and others
focus
self-discipline
confidence

They also learn:
the fundamentals of self protection
situational awareness
coordination
body and spatial awareness
how to roll and fall safely
proper form for punches and kicks
Japanese terms and concepts

We do not spar, and students under the age of 18 are not eligible to earn a black belt. As they advance, they will become eligible to join the juniors class.

The youth in our classes quickly learn that size is not an issue in performing techniques. What we teach does not need size or strength to perform, because it takes advantage of the way the human body is built. The students particularly enjoy being able to make techniques work on someone several times their size!

This separate program covers the same curriculum as the mixed classes, and is taught by the dojo's senior female instructor.

Why do we offer them? We recognize that some women are not initially comfortable training with men. If you are one, this gives you the opportunity to concentrate on learning the techniques while dealing with someone of the same gender being in your space.

Attendance at these classes does not allow attendance at any of the other classes, but you may transition to the regular classes at any time, as you become comfortable with the techniques. We encourage you to do so, as it will enable you to develop the skills to be able to deal with the psychological pressure of a male attacker, and to explore how to make the techniques work on individuals who are larger and/or heavier than you.

Regardless of in which classes you train, you will find the same friendly, supportive environment which has always been one of the hallmarks of our dojo. We do not spar or compete.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a safe and fun way to get kids off the couch and teach them problem solving skills that will help them to achieve their goal throughout their lives. Our Kid’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program teaches self-confidence, problem solving skills, fitness, and self-defense in a safe and professional facility.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu teaches students to address self defense and bullying situations against larger opponents without having to rely on strikes (punching and kicking) or dirty tricks (eye pokes, biting, etc)

Problem solving skills are an integral part of our Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Boxing training programs. Infinite Fighting Concepts focuses on a child’s ability to solve problems by themselves. This is the first step in a child’s path to becoming a well rounded adult. This will help them to make the most of life’s opportunities as well as give them a leg up in social situations. Inability to solve ones own problems often lead to frustration, aggressive behavior, acting out, poor performance in school, poor relationship skills, and inability to achieve goals.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is well suited for children of all ages. Bullying is a major issue with many children today. Most martial arts rely on size and strength, whereas IFC teaches the use of leverage and technique to overcome stronger and larger opponents.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a grappling system that will teach your child how to resolve a confrontation with out having to punch or kick their attacker to accomplish this goal.

So take the next step and call 301-330-5425 NOW and get your child on the road to their goals today. ";"N/A";"N/A";"Boxing, MMA, Muay Thai Kickboxing";"N/A";"http://www.ifcmma.com/schedule/";"Monday: 2:30 PM - 10:00 PM

KIDS JIU-JITSU at Yamasaki Academy in Rockville, MD

Master Fernando Yamasaki and Francisco Neto are the head instructors. Mr. Tod Arechiga is an assistant instructor.

Master Fernando Yamasaki and Francisco Neto use their expertise in Jiu-Jitsu, Judo and Wrestling in their kid’s program.
What is BJJ?

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art, combat sport and self-defense system that emphasizes getting an opponent to the ground in order to use ground fighting techniques and submission holds involving joint-locks and chokeholds. Today, professional self-defense training courses throughout the world, such as the U.S. Army’s Modern Army Combatives program, include some components of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

In this martial art, a smaller and weaker person can successfully defend his or herself from a larger and stronger opponent through using the proper technique and leverage. Once two fighters are on the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced by an experienced grappler who knows how to use mechanical advantage instead of brute strength. While other combat sports like wrestling and Judo traditionally use a takedown to bring an opponent to the ground, Jiu-Jitsu permits a wide variety of techniques and moves to bring the fight to the ground after taking a grip on the opponent.
Why Should Kids Learn Jiu-Jitsu?

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is known as the perfect martial art for children because it is a non-striking self-defense martial art system that steers children away from using brute strength and toward using their minds. This martial art style is considered to be one of the best self-defenses for kids and adults since it is applied in response to physical aggression, which will not lead to violence. The sport is also designed so that a smaller and weaker person or child can use leverage to defend him or herself against a larger and strong opponent.

Through learning Jiu-Jitsu, children will become more physically fit, and they will learn and develop skills that they can put to use off of the mat throughout their entire lives. Children practicing Jiu-Jitsu are expected to treat each other and their instructors with respect. This then creates a positive and respectful environment that demonstrates to the trainees the rewards that come with being courteous and respectful.
Kids’ Jiu-Jitsu at Yamasaki Academy

The Kid’s Jiu-Jitsu classes at Yamasaki Academy aim to create extra support for the parents by teaching children discipline, self-control, improved self-esteem and the ability to focus better on tasks. Since the sport of Jiu-Jitsu is completely non-violent, Yamasaki Academy provides a safe atmosphere with knowledgeable instructors who will ensure that students are training in a healthy manner without any stress or violence. Jiu-Jitsu is often referred to as “the gentle art” because it does not rely on “force against force.”

While working with children, Yamasaki Academy instructors understand that these training sessions are not all hard work and sweat. The friendly and supportive atmosphere created in each class will bring about plenty of smiles, giggles and laughs by the end of every session.

The belt and stripe ranking helps teach kids that they must earn things and achieve their goals through hard work. Through this, students earn their way up in belts based on attendance, attitude and skill level.

Sherri Laffey Sarrouf’s lifelong dream of offering a holistic fitness/strength and conditioning center came to fruition when SLS Fitness opened its doors in January 2010 in Lowell, MA.  Sherri wanted to offer individualized attention to all members. After years of watching countless people ‘working out’ not knowing what to do and/or not seeing results Sherri was intent on offering each member something different and unique.

Most workouts at SLS Fitness last only 30 Minutes! That’s it!  Her philosophy was to educate people to move well first and to train the body – not drain the body.  Her holistic approach focusing on healthy whole food nutrition and offering a wide variety of programs started a fitness revolution in the Merrimack Valley. Her goal was to place everything under one roof.From intense workouts and relaxation classes to yoga and meditation, to Pilates and beginner workouts, to boxing, MMA, Olympic lifting, Spartan Race training and strength and conditioning for both individuals of all ages and sports/school teams and groups. SLS has now grown to 3 locations and offers more than 180 classes per week!  SLS has partnered with Lowell General Hospital, Gametime – Jr. Spinners baseball, Rivals baseball, Rock Steady Parkinson’s boxing, Metabolic Effect, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.";"https://slsfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SLS-Logo-black.png";"https://slsfitness.com/classes/kids-boxing/";"Monday Wed and Thursdays 4:30pm

A class consists of warm-ups, games, and a lot of solo movements and drills which teach the young jiu jitsu practitioner how to fall down safely, roll, move on the ground, move in self-defense stance, and how to get back to one’s feet from the ground.

We offer a variety of classes such as Gi Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, Sambo, Wrestling, MMA and Judo. Our center focuses on providing a fun and exciting training experience so that your WHOLE family can get fit and learn powerful martial arts in an upbeat, safe environment.

Are you NEW to martial arts and maybe a bit nervous about it… wondering if you’ll fit in or will be able to keep up? There’s nothing to fear because we’ll guide you every step of the way and with every kick and punch you perform – we promise.

It doesn’t matter if you’re a total beginner, have some experience or are an elite athlete… we’ll train you safely and in a way that meets your needs and fitness level. After all, your goals are our goals and it’s a team effort here at Broadway Jiu-Jitsu.

You’re going to LOVE what Martial Arts does for your body, mind and spirit as you get…

    Tremendous focus and clarity
    Skyrocketing confidence and courage
    A fantastic workout, strong core, and a super-toned body
    Improved self-control, discipline and goal-setting skills
    Greater respect for self and others
    Peace of mind knowing you have powerful self-defense skills

Our programs are not only an excellent way to get in the BEST shape of your life and give you a way to enjoy a healthy lifestyle, but they’re also a great way to reduce stress, anxiety and depression.

You may think that all those AMAZING benefits would cost a fortune – and they probably do at other martial arts studios – but not here at Broadway Jiu-Jitsu. In fact, we like to think of our classes as “affordable excellence.”

Have you checked out the CRAZY-LOW web special going on right now? Classes fill up fast because it’s such a great deal – and 100% RISK-FREE - so reserve your spot today!

If you have a shy or introverted child, our excellent instructors can help turn them into a confident child who presents well at school or any social event. Our training is also more personal and geared to meet your goals. Whether it’s for weight loss, self-defense, or an outlet to unwind and have some fun, our awesome staff can help you achieve your goals.

Every epic kick and powerful punch will boost your confidence, no matter what age you are. Your child will learn how to be BULLY-PROOF, how to be more aware of people and their surroundings and spot sticky situations so they can walk away before things get bad.

Your whole family will learn how to defend yourselves if necessary, and all that CONFIDENCE carries over into other parts of your life too. Adults are better able to step out of their comfort zone and take on bigger challenges at work to their success.

Our experienced team of caring instructors goes above and beyond the call of duty and makes every class fun, exciting and challenging. They LOVE what they do and boy does it show!

Every instructor will EMPOWER you to be fit, strong and healthy. They also put a lot of emphasis on character development and learning valuable life lessons which goes a long way in creating leaders and role models.

Aside from all of the classes offered in the Adults BMAC Program , our school offers a set of classes designed to introduce women to the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art designed to allow the weaker to defeat the stronger.
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a perfect fit for women who are interested in learning how to protect themselves and well as work out.
We pride ourselves in offering a comprehensive Women’s martial arts program that allows women to become strong, independent and confident.
Our Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Program combines a comprehensive self-defense curriculum with emphasis on drills that simulate realistic attack and escape situations.
The techniques are complemented by a strong fitness component that is second to none compared to classes offered in regular gyms.

Cross Training for Women
Cross Training for Women is not a specialized fitness program, but a deliberate attempt to optimize physical competence in each of 10 recognized fitness domains: cardiovascular and respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy.
Cross Training coaches like to point out that even champions in certain sports have huge gaps in their fitness, as defined by the above 10 domains. Ironman competitors score high in some areas, low in others. The marathoner dominates cardio endurance but he isn’t strong. The powerlifter is strong, but often has very low endurance and can’t do a single pull-up.
If your goal is to specialize and compete in one sport, then Cross Training isn’t for you. Instead, the goal of the Cross Trainer is to become “competent” in all 10 domains. He may never be a top gymnast but he will develop great body control. He may never win a marathon, but he can enter a 5K without training for it and finish near the top.

Our regular school year runs from September through June, and typically, we only add new students in September, January and April. Most classes have a waiting list to enroll, so please contact us as early as possible if you would like to enroll your child in our program. Once a spot is available, we have all students come in and try a first class for free (usually working in a small group of 2-3 new students to allow the child to feel more comfortable.) This allows the child and the parent to experience our program prior to making a decision. Also, it allows our instructors a chance to make a personal connection with the child, as well as gain insight into their learning style before they are put into a larger class setting. If you have any other questions please let us know, by emailing us at admin@davissquaremartialarts.com or calling us at (617) 591-9656.

Children’s  Programs Ages 3-15 years old. (confidence, discipline, respect & fun)

The emphasis of the children’s class is to create a positive learning environment in which students can safely learn martial arts. Every child is different, but all students are encouraged to do the best they can to reach their individual potential. Through listening and putting effort into every class children will develop physically (increased strength, flexibility, balance and coordination) and mentally (increased confidence, determination, patience and self-esteem). The mental and physical discipline they develop will serve them throughout their lives.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://davissquaremartialarts.com/?page_id=241";"Monday: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM, 3:00 PM - 9:00 PM

O-Sensei, or “great teacher” as he was called, then developed this long hidden principle into a self-defense art for personal development and the creation of a more peaceful society. This he called “Aikido.” Grasping the secret of Aiki, movement becomes effortless and graceful, even while manifesting great power. 

The art of Aikido unifies offense and defense and teaches the art of remaining neutral and balanced between the two. Based on the battlefield martial arts of Japan, Aikido utilizes all methods of barehanded training as well as short staff and sword.

Aikido is a martial art without competition. The founder forbid formal competitive matches in order to develop awareness of all possible attacks and maintain the reality of actual combat. The harmonious and natural structure of Aikido allows full contact and full speed training with very little risk of injury. In this way it is an enjoyable practice for men, women, and children of all ages. ";"http://www.shobu.org/img/xShobulogo2.png.pagespeed.ic.SleZeblCWr.png";"http://www.shobu.org/kids.html";"

Children's aikido classes provide a friendly, non-competitive environment for students to become more physically fit, agile, flexible, aware, focused, and relaxed. They learn how to safely fall, roll and perform a variety of self-defense techniques in a supportive, comfortable setting.

Parents like Aikido because kids learn how to be powerful without becoming destructive! Classes involve warm-ups, basic stretching and conditioning, partner practice and games. Aikido is a fun way to get fit and discover the mind/body connection.

Children ages 8-11 are ideal candidates for our current Tue/Thurs classes - if your child is older or younger please contact us as we maybe able to accommodate you in a future class.

...While Making Sure They Have a TON of Fun

Martial arts classes normally makes you think of self-defense, being strong, fit and safe. The truth is, it’s all that and WAY more!

A Few Words
From Richard Comeau

I’m Richard Comeau, Owner / Chief Instructor here at 5 Dragons Martial Arts Academy.

As a martial arts instructor with extensive experience training kids, there is nothing better than seeing them grow firsthand.

But more important than the martial arts skills they learn… is the personal skills they develop and carry for life.

Because martial arts is so much more than just kicking and punching, and getting the next colorful belt.

It’s about developing confidence, discipline, character, focus and respect.

With every class we teach, your kids are growing in mind, body and character.

That’s because martial arts provides instant positive feedback. Through learning to focus on the core moves, they develop discipline and respect. They can instantly see and feel a difference, making them destined to build confidence, self-awareness and self-respect.

And of course it’s a ton of FUN!

That’s why I love teaching martial arts to kids in this community, and why I know your kids are going to LOVE training.

So please have a look below to find out exactly how your kids can benefit from our fun martial arts classes.

Thanks!

Does Your Child Have
Any of these challenges?

They are great kids but they just don’t listen, often being told to do something a hundred times before they actually do anything.

They’re bright and intelligent, yet have trouble paying attention at home, in school or in any important situation, even being classified as an “ADD” or “ADHD” child.

They are simply shy and lack the confidence and self-esteem needed to live up to their full potential.

The Difficulties of Raising Children Are Near Endless
Luckily there is a comprehensive solution…

There really is a safe, natural and extremely effective way to take charge and positively impact every aspect of your child’s life. It doesn’t take medicine, therapy, harsh actions, or cajoling your kids to change their behavior. Instead, it is teaching your kids self-discipline, hard work, confidence, and respect. This done in a way that empowers them while also teaching them humility, and promoting health and fitness… all at the same time.

Sounds like a wonder cure doesn’t it?

But there really is something that does all that. And that’s the power of martial arts classes.

your child will grow with every class!

Respect is a cornerstone of martial arts instruction

Kids who don’t respect themselves and others often have difficulties in school and in life. Martial arts teaches the importance of respect every day.

We teach students to respect their instructors and fellow students. They can’t succeed without respecting everyone in the studio.

Over time, the instinct to respect others becomes deeply ingrained – and your child will carry it with them forever.

Learning discipline creates opportunities

Nobody can succeed in life without the discipline to keep going even when things are difficult.

Our students learn discipline and persistence. Martial arts training requires true diligence and that’s not possible without discipline.

Students are held to the highest standard of behavior at all times – and the discipline they learn here will help them everywhere else.";"N/A";"N/A";"Fitness Kickboxing ";"N/A";"Schedule available after signup!";"Monday: 4:30 PM - 9:00 PM

We strive to take our workouts to a level that ensures our results in all aspects. Form is always a priority as well as making sure we are working efficiently towards our goals, whatever the may be. If you’re looking to take your training to the next level, then this is the the exclusive gym for you!
We offer facets of powerlifting, bodybuilding, Athletic strength & conditioning, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Kickboxing, and Mixed Martial Arts. We also offer team training for your sport whatever it may be and have successfully worked with semi pro as well as professional athletes from a range of sports.

Boom! Athletics as an idea was created by Sean Seaberg back in 2007 while Sean was working with clients at a gym in Methuen Massachusetts. Sean would always say “Boom” without realizing it when people would be hitting good reps and doing well. Eventually one of his clients made him a shirt that said “Boom” on the front and had his other slogan on the back which is “Hate me now, Love me later.” As time went on he came up with the name Boom! Athletics and he has been using it ever since.

The basis is revolved around stability and balance while the rest follows with strength, agility, coordination, speed in attempts to bring all these things together in a progressive manner.
Sean Seaberg has been weightlifting since he was 11 years old and has been a certified personal trainer since age 18. He has worked with hundreds of clients over the years and has helped many people create their success stories. He has trained professional athletes, special needs populations, extreme weight loss clients, post rehabilitation clients and everything in between.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c2.0.200.200/p200x200/1800181_920347704656908_6952835288536996373_n.png?oh=5e197b2d816bd984be9c3a44aecf23d6&oe=5B3042B1";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"MMA, Kickboxing";"N/A";"https://www.boomathletics.net/schedule/the-board/";"Monday: 6:00 AM - 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM - 8:30 PM

Worcester pronunciation is a city and the county seat of Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. Named after Worcester, England, as of the 2010 Census the city's population was 181,045, making it the second most populous city in New England after Boston. Worcester is located approximately 40 miles west of Boston, 50 miles east of Springfield and 40 miles north of Providence. Due to its location in Central Massachusetts, Worcester is known as the ""Heart of the Commonwealth"", thus, a heart is the official symbol of the city. However, the heart symbol may also have its provenance in lore that the mass-produced Valentine's Day card was invented in the city. Worcester was considered its own distinct region apart from Boston until the 1970s. Since then, Boston's suburbs have been moving out further westward, especially after the construction of Interstate 495 and Interstate 290. The Worcester region now marks the western periphery of the Boston-Worcester-Providence U.S. Census Combined Statistical Area , or Greater Boston. The city features many examples of Victorian-era mill architecture.

Worcester, MA, with surrounding areas in Shrewsbury, Grafton, Auburn, Millbury, or West Boylston, is home to Worcester Martial Arts Academy, a Martial Arts facility focusing on programs in Birthday Parties, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu / Judo, Kids Martial Arts, Mixed Martial Arts, Self Defense, and Women's Kickboxing.

Benefits from Every Class.

Action-Packed
Fitness and Exercise.

Action-packed games, activities, and
exercises give kids a great workout
from head to toe.

They get stronger, healthier and more fit within just a couple weeks. These fun exercises also help maintain a healthy weight!

The best part? The fitness is disguised as FUN! All your child will know is that they’re having a blast. But you and I know they’re also getting the exercise they need.



Self-Defense From Strangers, Bullies, and More.

Make no mistake about it: While our classes are tons of fun, we also cover the ""serious"" stuff too.

We teach kids about handling strangers... bullies... and more.

However, the first thing we teach is diplomacy. We give your child the tools they need to ""talk it out"" first. Violence is ALWAYS a last resort!

Powerful Character Development Breeds Discipline, Focus, and Respect.

For thousands of years, martial arts has been one of the best kept secrets for giving kids the skills they need for success in life.

Through inspiring stories and talks, as well as the process of learning the techniques, kids develop amazing traits, like:

Respect, discipline, focus, and goal setting.

I hope your child will never have to use their self-defense skills. But I guarantee these other skills will come in handy EVERY day for the rest of their life.

Fun, Fun, Fun!!!

While kids work hard and train hard in our classes...

... They also smile and laugh a LOT, too!

After all, these are kids we’re dealing with here! Our classes are a great place for kids to socialize, make friends, get support, and have a blast.

The funnest, most action-packed workout of your life. Guaranteed.

Kickboxing class FLIES by! Even though it's a full-hour, full-body workout... it goes by in a flash.

That's because almost nothing on this planet is as fun as punching and kicking the heck out of a heavy bag.

You'll feel like a total pro - and your body will transform fast.

Melt calories, burn fat, and tone muscle - from head to toe.

EVERY part of your body gets a workout in kickboxing! That includes your arms, chest, stomach, hips, butt, thighs, and calves.

That means ALL your trouble spots won't trouble you for much longer! And every part of you will get stronger, leaner, and fitter.

In fact, you can burn up to 800 calories (or more) EVERY time you come! Ladies, how awesome is that?
 
Beginners are more than welcome!

99% of our members have never thrown a kick or a punch in their life! So if you're a total beginner - you're in good company!

There's nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about! Everyone here was once a beginner - so we just want to support you and help you learn, get fit, and grow.

Fair enough?
You're joining more than a calorie-blasting workout... You're joining an amazing, supportive family.

Women come here for the fat-melting workouts... but they stay for the people.

Our community here is really something - and I can't wait for you to join it too.

Friendships are born all the time. People give each other support and accountability to stay on track.

It really feels like a family, and I know from day 1 you'll feel it.
Out of shape?
No problem! In shape?
Get ready to take it to
the next level.

The great thing about kickboxing is even though it's a group environment... everyone's doing their own individual exercises.

That means you go at a pace that's right for YOU.

Out of shape? Take it slow and build up your endurance over time. Already an athlete? Step it up and crush your limits.

Our amazing instructors will motivate the heck out of you to grow and reach new heights, too. So don't worry about motivation.

Violence is not inevitable. We all have the ability to stop it.

Since 1971, IMPACT has been teaching solutions for safe living. IMPACT provides realistic personal safety training that gives people the skills to respond appropriately to threatening situations in the moment of fear or intimidation. We also collaborate with schools and organizations to create programs that proactively prevent abuse. IMPACT’s prevention programs emphasize giving people the tools to manage their adrenaline or stress responses so they can intervene effectively when they observe risky situations. Too often abuse goes unchallenged because people don’t feel safe speaking up. IMPACT programs help people increase their ability to safely advocate for themselves and others.
Realistic Scenarios

Our self-defense classes simulate scenarios of threat, intimidation and violence perpetrated by strangers and people we know. Classes are taught by a team of two instructors, one of whom takes on the role of a perpetrator. He wears a full suit of body armor so students can safely defend themselves using the same force needed in a real attack.
A Fight Avoided is a Fight Won

Physical self-defense is always a last resort. Students learn verbal skills to de-escalate conflict and avoid unnecessary violence. Many assailants use verbal threats to intimidate people, so IMPACT teaches students to stay calm and respond effectively to harassment.
Building Confidence

IMPACT gives people the opportunity to be effective and successful in the face of fear. Having  this experience has helped people heal from past trauma and take on new challenges.
Experienced Instructors

IMPACT programs are led by a diverse group of instructors whose expertise includes education, counseling, domestic violence, sexual assault, criminal justice, youth development, and martial arts. All IMPACT instructors complete a 200+ hour certification program.

Krav Maga Boston Malden was established in 1999 in Dennisport, MA as the first Krav Maga school in New England and one of few on the entire East Coast.

In 2001 we relocated to the Boston area are now teaching programs at the Bayshore Athletic Club in Braintree, Brandeis University and the Yarmouth Police Department.

We have also taught Police Officers who are members of our local Police Departments including Boston, Brookline, Yarmouth, Harwich, Barnstable, Quincy, Braintree, the State Police, F.B.I., Secret Service, I.C.E. and several local Coast Guard Units.

We are located in Malden, where we offer classes 5 days per week. We also host all sorts of Seminars including Women’s Only, Law Enforcement Only, Car Jacking, Home Invasion and Weapon Defenses Seminars. We also travel to Corporations and provide training for staff members and team building programs.

 
What is Krav Maga

Krav Maga, the official fighting and self-defense system of the Israeli military, emerged in an environment where extreme violence was common and a self-defense system was desperately needed. Krav Maga was designed to be learned quickly and must work for everyone, regardless of their size, strength or athletic ability. Due to it’s instinctive movements and straight forward approach, the techniques are easy to retain with minimal review and can be performed under extreme stress. This makes Krav Maga easy to master, even for a novice. Krav Maga has been tested and improved under real-life conditions, proving to be an ideal system for defending oneself in the face of life threatening danger.

The principles of Krav Maga are simple: 1) Address the immediate danger. 2) Attack simultaneously. 3) Eliminate the threat. 4) Disengage.

No self-defense system in the world is more battle-tested than Krav Maga.

WOMEN-ONLY SEMINARS

Nearly two million women are assaulted each year in the United States, and more than half of women will be physically assaulted during their lifetime. As a woman, the matter of your safety is your own responsibility. In Krav Maga, there are no hard-and-fast rules, and no distinction in training for men and women. It is not a sport, and all the techniques focus on maximum efficiency in real-life conditions. Attackers pick on women that are perceived to be easy victims. It doesn’t matter how tough you really are, but how tough the attacker perceives you to be.

We teach women to walk like predators, not prey, learn to spot danger signs, and to defend themselves when no danger signs are evident. We teach them how to turn fear into power and to be aware of their surroundings at all times. More importantly, they learn how to function under the shock and stress of a sudden violent encounter.

You can mix and match what your want to learn. Some people only choose
one program while others are interested in training in all of the programs.

One of the hidden upsides to training at Mass BJJ is the community that has
been built around both schools. A common theme that we hear when we ask
students for feedback on our program, is how pleasantly surprised they are at
the community of people that have become an extended family for so many of
our practitioners. Mass BJJ is a place that offers so much more than just lessons
in martial arts. It is hard not to get to know one another as we spend so much
time on the mat together. And we have come to support one another through
all the difficult times and celebrate together for all the happy times both on
and off the mat.

We train our body to be strong, and our mind and spirit to be patient, in order to become the best human beings we can be. Karate is a spiritual endeavor, a way to develop a person as an inividual. Everything we learn in the dojo should be applied to everyday life. Karate training is not always easy. Often times it can be very difficult and demanding. This is also true of life. If we overcome obstacles in our training, it enables us to have strong character to do the same in our everyday lives. 
  The very essence of karate, the main purpose of training- is all about improving ourselves. We must always work hard at this. When we take responsibility to become persons of good character and integrity, we will be doing our part to make the world a better place, which in turn can help to bring peace to the world. It is also my personal goal, and the goal of Sarah's School of Martial Arts, to teach not only karate techniques, but moreover, to do our best to guide our members in the understanding of what it means to be a true martial artist. A true martial artist constantly strives to be a good human being. 
It is the spiritual inspiration of this Shotokan philosophy that gives me the determination and resolve to pass on to my students these same teachings. It is my sincere hope that all of our members do the same and pass on my and Master Funakoshi's philosophy for generations to come.
  As human beings, we are all the same, and have the same vulnerabilites. This is human nature. We can overcome many things if we first understand and accept this about ourselves. If we accept the good and bad about ourselves, it is much easier to accept these things in others. To be a true martial artist, we must accept nature and continually work on perfecting our character. This daily process should be as routine as waking up in the morning. That is the true power of a good martial artist.

This half hour long class is specifically guided towards our 3.5 year olds. We start with an introduction to bowing upon entering the dojo floor and how it shows respect to instructors, fellow students and the dojo itself. Using games and humor, we focus on teaching balance, respect, basic kicks and the importance of listening to your parents.

Beginner
In this forty five minute class we teach the basics of Shotokan karate, including kicks, strikes, blocks, and the first kata, (Heian Shodan). White belts take this class and advance to the next level after their 3rd stripe on their belt.  Monthly themes are implemented into this class to show the importance of being respectful, treating others equally, sharing and much more. We also play games in this class as well!

Intermediate
This forty five minute class consists of orange, gold and green belts. Another kata, Heian Sundan, is also incorporated in here as well as tougher kicks, punches, blocks and strikes.  Since this is an intermediate level class, more is expected from the children such as better listening, harder work ethic, and respecting others. We also review different methods to stand up to a bully in a safe way. Fun games are played in this class as a reward for good behavior and hard work.

Advanced
This forty five minute class is guided towards our blue, purple, brown and red belts. Much more is expected from this class, behavior and technique wise, than the intermediate and beginner levels. This class involves katas, basics, weapons, and sparring. Students also learn how to defend themselves against guns, clubs and knives.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or BJJ, is a unique, grappling martial art. There is no striking or kicking. Instead, we learn how to apply leverage to control and subdue an opponent or attacker. Originally developed by the Gracie family in Brazil, BJJ has become famous in the United States in recent years because of its widespread use by MMA fighters as well as for its effectiveness in self-defense.

BJJ training is different from some martial arts because we do not memorize any forms or techniques to practice individually. From the first day, even the youngest students train with a live partner. The result is dynamic, practical self-defense skills and a high level of fitness and coordination.

Our Fall 2017 training schedule begins Wednesday, September 6.

    Monday/Wednesday 4:00-5:00pm

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is one of the fastest growing sports for children, because it teaches body movements that are safe, fun, and empowering. It is one of the only martial arts that focuses on grips, holds, and positions using leverage (rather than punches, kicks, or throws).

The unique Juniors BJJ program created by Keith and Kenny Florian focuses on defensive strategies – such as how to break free if someone grabs you, how to redirect the force if someone tries to push you, etc. Classes are taught by an instructor specializing in teaching children.

For maximum safety, classes are taught on 2 inch zebra mats, allowing everyone to roll around safely. Kids love the movements and techniques they practice in these classes.

Kids learn discipline and self-empowerment – invaluable tools against bullying and other distractions from school and personal development. Our program uses martial arts skills as a way to promote life skills; which include self discipline, improved grades and good sportsmanship.

Several of our Junior students compete in tournaments. And a number of our students have a parent that trains in adult classes, because of the family-friendly environment we promote. It is very easy to fall in love with the jiu jitsu program at Florian Martial Arts.

The best way to get a sense of the practical benefits this Florian martial arts program provides is to stop by and watch a class!";"http://florianmartialartscenter.com/women-martial-arts-school-boston-brookline/";"Female students at Florian Martial Arts Center participate in the regular co-ed classes for beginners and advanced students, learning to deal with different shapes and strengths in a friendly and non-intimating environment.

In these classes women study how to use leverage, flexibility, and body mechanics to achieve control over any situation. Punches, kicks, and throws are not used in jiu jitsu. All positions start on the ground, and are practiced safely on soft zebra mats.

With proper technique, and disciplined practice, it is possible to redirect and use an aggressor’s strength against him. You’ll have the skills to defend yourself and get away. This stuff works!

For more and more women, a jiu jitsu practice of this kind complements a practice of yoga, running, or personal training. Going over techniques in the classes at Florian Martial Arts is not only a good work out, it also develops agility and body awareness. And it is a lot of fun too!

Ann Arbor - Martial Arts Mecca

For the prospective martial arts student, Ann Arbor is a mecca in the Midwest. More than any other location in Michigan, Ann Arbor has a wide variety of martial arts styles taught by many well respected sensei (teachers). You can find training opportunities at community centers, college and university gyms, health clubs, fitness centers and dojos (training halls). Among the styles available are: aikido, iaido, judo, jiu-jitsu (also called jujutsu), karate, kendo, kung fu, MMA (mixed martial arts, sometimes called BJJ) tae kwon do, tai chi, and many westernized martial arts systems. At JMAC, we offer world class instruction in judo, jiu-jitsu, iaido (Japanese swordsmanship), and karate for kids.
Aikido

Aikido is a martial arts descended from jiu-jitsu. It includes joint locks, throws, takedowns, and pins. The philosophy of aikido is a peaceful one - to use the attacker’s energy to neutralize his or her attack without causing injury. Aikido is taught in several forms, such as Aikikai, Ki Society, and Yoshinkan. Aikido was founded by Ueshiba Morihei, who studied with Takeda Sokaku, the most famous practitioner of Daito Ryu Aiki-Jujutsu. Its principles can be found in almost every Japanese martial art, especially jiu-jitsu and judo. Read more about the physical and philosophical principles of Nihon Jujutsu.
Iaido in Ann Arbor

Iaido is Japanese sword drawing. It was created by the Samurai to defend against surprise attacks by an armed opponent. Most iaido involves the practice of pre-arranged forms, which are excellent tools for training the body, improving concentration, and entering into a meditative state. Finding a talented instructor in iaido with legitimate credentials is rare … in the Midwest it’s practically unheard of. For those with a desire to compete in swordsmanship for sport, kendo is the activity of choice. Those who are willing to endure an occasional whack on the head may pursue bokken kumite (sparring with wooden swords) with our director’s authorization once they reach black belt at JMAC. Read more about iaido at JMAC.
Ann Arbor Judo

Judo was founded by Professor Jigoro Kano. It is both a martial art and an Olympic sport. It includes throws, pins, joint locks, and chokes. It is among the most vigorous of martial arts and is very popular with children as well as adults. The Japanese Martial Arts Center offers classes in judo for children as young as 6 years old, and for adults (starting at age 16). One fact not widely known is that sport judo is a narrow cross section of the complete art of judo. Proponents of the entire art, such as Satoh Tadayuki Sensei of Waseda University in Tokyo, recognize that the founder’s vision encompassed not only “judo” throws, but joint locks, takedowns, redirection, strikes, vital points, dynamic ukemi, kata, and weapons. Judo training at JMAC includes many of these opportunities. Read more about Judo at JMAC.
Ann Arbor Jiu-Jitsu (Jujitsu / Jujutsu)

Jujutsu - which is also written ""jujitsu"" and ""jiu jitsu"" - is the ancestor martial art of aikido and judo. Although it includes many of the techniques found in aikido, as well as many more combative techniques that did not find their way into aikido, the philosophy of jujutsu is more practical. Techniques are applied more directly, with a greater emphasis on pain compliance. Those who study jiu-jitsu over the long term improve their fitness, concentration, and ability to defend themselves. The Japanese Martial Arts Center offers serious jiu-jitsu classes for adults starting at age 16. You can learn more about the differences between Japanese jujutsu and Brazilian jiujitsu.
Karate – Kids Karate in Ann Arbor

Karate involves mainly strikes, kicks, and blocks. It was originally developed in the Ryukyu Islands (now Okinawa), and was later exported to Japan before finding its way around the world. Karate is an excellent martial art for those who prefer striking, and helps develop physical strength, stamina, and confidence. There are many forms of karate taught around the world today, including Shotokan, Shorin-ryu, Chito-Ryu, Goju-Ryu, and Kyokushinkai. If you’re looking for a way to help your child learn enthusiasm, fitness, discipline, and manners while having a lot of fun, consider the kids karate program at JMAC. We have an incredible core of talented instructors who have made it their business to inspire kids to be their best. Read more about our karate program for kids.
Kendo

Kendo is a sport descended from Japanese swordsmanship. In Kendo, participants wear padded armor and attempt to score points by striking vital points with bamboo swords called ""shinai."" Practice is fast paced, involves much spirited shouting, and is a lot of fun. The Japanese Martial Arts Center does not offer kendo, but can refer you to a reputable kendo instructor in the area.
Kung Fu

Kung Fu is a Chinese martial art that actually includes many sub-styles. Like karate, kung fu involves strikes, kicks, and blocks, but also includes many esoteric motions that can be applied to take down or otherwise defeat an opponent. Kung fu often appeals to imaginative people because of the many references to animal forms, but it is also a very challenging and practical martial art.
MMA (Mixed Martial Arts)

MMA (mixed martial arts) to a modern competition-based collection of techniques. Most MMA schools teach striking as well as grappling. Although not a traditional martial art - and thus lacking many of the character development and spiritual aspects of ancient Asian arts - MMA is nevertheless a fantastic form of exercise and a lot of fun. Because many MMA fighters have employed judo and jujutsu successfully, the Japanese Martial Arts Center offers private instruction to top-level competitors as well as occasional workshops for our members.
Tae Kwon Do

Tae Kwon Do is the Korean counterpart to Japanese karate. As a striking art, it includes punches, kicks, and blocks, but typically Tae Kwon Do emphasizes more kicking than does karate. Competition (usually for points rather than full contact) is very common among Tae Kwon Do practitioners. It is an excellent form of exercise, but seems more susceptible to commercialization than more traditional arts such as aikido and iaido.
Tai Chi

Tai Chi is another form of Chinese martial art. It is usually taught with slow, controlled movements and deep stances. There are many health benefits associated with Tai Chi, including strong bones, cardiovascular health, and calmness.
Getting Started in Martial Arts in Ann Arbor

If you are considering taking up martial arts, you will find many superb opportunities in and around Ann Arbor, including outlying cities such as Brighton, Canton, Howell, Northville, and Plymouth. Students from the University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, Washtenaw Community College, Cleary College, and even Michigan State University have supplemented their education with martial arts and found that the physical activity helps them concentrate on their studies. We think the Japanese Martial Arts Center offers the best programs in Michigan, but we’re interested in people who are willing to work hard and do what it takes to become truly accomplished. We encourage you to look around to find the martial arts club or school that best meets your needs.";"https://japanesemartialartscenter.com/img/japanese-martial-arts-center.png";"https://japanesemartialartscenter.com/kids";"Martial Arts For Kids
Parents call us almost every day to ask about our kids martial arts programs.

The most frequent questions we get asked are:

“Can you help my child focus?”

“Can you teach my child some discipline?” or

“My child is getting bullied at school. Can you help?”

It’s very common to wonder about whether martial arts will be good for your child, and maybe if karate or judo will offer your child something he or she won’t get in school or while playing with friends.
Teaching Kids Great Values and Safe Martial Arts in Ann Arbor

Wouldn't it be helpful for you to stop in and watch a kids martial arts class with your child to make sure the environment is positive and safe? Wouldn't it be helpful if you knew what your child will experience, and that they wouldn’t be asked to do anything dangerous or violent, but would get in shape, learn good values, and develop habits to help them succeed at home and in the world?

Most of our instructors are parents, too, and like you we hope our children will develop their full potential, have a great self image, and be able to apply focus and patience to achieving their aims in life. We’d all love it if our kids were healthy and respectful at home, too.
Thoughtful, Carefully Developed Martial Arts for Ann Arbor Kids

We teach kids in a very carefully developed, thoughtful way. We disguise most of the learning as fun, and we vary the rhythm of class to keep them interested. You’ll see how our kids are learning to move well, to pay attention to their instructors, and to love the learning process. Most days, you’ll be able to see a range of abilities, from the newcomer who is often shy and who has trouble doing the stances and movements, to the child who has been attending for a year or two who moves sharply, pays attention, and who is beginning to become a role model for the other kids. When you and your child have seen a class and you’re ready for your child to try it out, you can set up the private intro lessons with one of our black belt instructors.
Kids Martial Arts - One Safe, Joyful Step at a Time!

The first step in developing young martial artists is to help them learn to love the experience. The second step is to let them feel the connection between joyful practice and accomplishment. The third step is to pay close attention and make sure we’re giving them what they need to feel engaged, and what they need to feel they're making progress. We’ve carefully developed our program to follow this plan, and it really pays off for the kids at JMAC. We think you’ll be delighted to watch your child grow, too!";"https://japanesemartialartscenter.com/women";"Martial Arts for Women in Ann Arbor

We’ve worked with a lot of great female martial artists over the years, and many have really seized the chance to master a traditional Japanese martial art. But for many women, concern about going into an unfamiliar dojo can be huge. We’ve listened, and some of the issues women have mentioned to us are:

“Will I be able to do martial arts?”

“Is your dojo full of macho men?”

Or sometimes just really simple questions like:

“Will I be welcomed by the others?”

Or “Is your dojo a clean, welcoming place?”

Many women who joined us started out with these worries or other concerns about taking up martial arts. Our guess is that it would be helpful if you could stop in and watch a class without being pressured, to ensure it's safe and welcoming.

Would it also be helpful if you knew that we’ve had girls as young as six and women as old as sixty-five train successfully at our dojo, and among our ranks are women who achieved not just black belt, but higher levels of black belt? We create a tough but reasonable environment that helps both men and women achieve their goals, and we’d be very interested in learning what concerns you about starting out in the martial arts.

You’ve probably heard about all the benefits of a good martial arts program: greater confidence, improved mental focus, an understanding of Japanese budo culture, and the ability to defend yourself. Wouldn’t you like to experience the relaxed confidence of someone whose physical and mental balance functions at a high level, who sweats with confidence and joy while building expert skills, and who can move with power and grace? We think that sounds GREAT!
The Mastery Process - Women in the Martial Arts

Our entire curriculum is centered around the mastery process. We're interested in developing all our students, and since each person comes to us with abilities, there’s no “one size fits all” approach at JMAC. We pay attention to what you do well, assist you at improving moves you find difficult, and offer guidance about what you can outside the dojo to improve your mental and physical fitness. We don’t tolerate bullying. Our mission is to create an atmosphere of mutual cooperation and development. Our standards are high, but we’re here to help you achieve!

You start out at JMAC by watching a class. If the training is something you'd like to try, you can arrange two private intro lessons with no cost or obligation. In those lessons, we’ll teach you the basic etiquette of Japanese martial arts as well as a few fundamentals of your martial art. After you’ve completed those lessons we’ll explain what it takes to get started. There's no pressure  - we only want students at JMAC who truly want to be here, who are seriously interested in self-improvement.";"N/A";"https://japanesemartialartscenter.com/fees";"https://japanesemartialartscenter.com/schedule";"Monday: CLOSED

Kids Learn How To Defend Themselves - Many different martial arts claim to teach self-defense, but not every style is practical in the real world. With the majority of physical altercations ending up on the ground, especially in the schoolyard, children must be prepared to defend themselves on the ground and control a bully without ever throwing a punch! Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is the non-violent, submission based self-defense system, trusted by everyone from our military and first responders to air marshals to defend themselves, diffuse a situation, and control an adversary.
​
Build Confidence & Improve Their Behavior - Kids with high self confidence & high self esteem are happier & healthier, tend to have better behavior and fewer tantrums or lash outs, and they are much less likely to be targets for bullies! Jiu Jitsu is an individual sport that celebrates personal achievement and goal setting, and helps children understand their own body type as they develop a style that works to highlight their strengths, and minimize their weaknesses, and helps them become comfortable in their own skin.

Its Great For Their Health! - Childhood obesity is on the rise with roughly 1 in 3 children classified as overweight. Schools are cutting the amount of time spent in gym, outdoor free play, and recess. In order for children to be physically healthy and maintain healthy bodies, they MUST participate in physical activity outside of school. Martial arts is a fantastic option for ALL children, especially those children who might, “ride the bench,” in team sports. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is designed for the smaller weaker opponent to be able to outskill and beat a much larger opponent. It will challenge everyone from the non-athlete to the superstar, and everyone in between. 
​
They Get To Make Great Friends - Physical, emotional, and mental health are important, but what about “social health?’ Every kid needs friends, teammates, and mentors. Martial arts is a rare example of a sport where boys and girls practice together, leading to twice as many opportunities to build friendships. If your child makes friends easily, GREAT! They’ll make many more. If your child struggles to make friends or has some social difficulty in school, the environment at URSA Academy with other kids who share similar interests and experiences may be just what they need to break out of their shell, make friends, and have fun!

Kids 'Bully Breakthrough' Self-Defense
“Bully Breakthrough” Self-Defense! A MUST for kids ages 7 - 14!

Kids develop instincts, boost confidence, & learn techniques to defend themselves! The majority of schoolyard/bully altercations end up on the ground, and most martial arts & self defense classes focus on techniques that can only be used while standing. ​

URSA Academy’s “Bully Breakthrough” self-defense class teaches students what to do both standing AND on the ground. From prevention & how to diffuse a situation to stand-up techniques, and controlling an opponent on the ground with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu submissions and defenses. These techniques are then drilled in a fun and safe environment to develop muscle memory and proper instincts. Our kids have a blast learning real Brazilian Jiu Jitsu self defense while getting fit & athletic through focused drilling and high energy classes.

Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
Designed for students who have graduated from our Kids ‘Bully Breakthrough’ Self-Defense program, or those students coming to URSA Academy with BJJ grappling experience, our Kids Advanced Brazilian Jiu Jitsu program goes beyond the basics into fun and dynamic intermediate & advanced level self defense, grappling, and sport jiu jitsu.

​In our 60 minute KABJJ classes, Black Belt Professor Kris Magers leads students through conditioning exercises, focused technique, fun flow drills, high energy reps, and disciplined live sparring guaranteed to increase your child’s level of physical fitness, athleticism, self defense skill, strategic thinking and overall jiu jitsu prowess. This program follows the International Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation’s system of belt ranking and promotion which holds up anywhere in the world!

But. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is about so much more than advanced techniques, self-defense, and rolling! The Kids Advanced Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class strongly emphasizes character development through mat chats with our coaches, positive relationships with teammates & mentors, as well as character development projects completed outside of URSA Academy!";"N/A";"N/A";"Fitness Kickboxing";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Kris Magers";"1 free trial class offer!";"Reception@URSAAcademy.com";"https://www.facebook.com/URSAAcademy/";"http://www.youtube.com/user/rjjaannarbor?sub_confirmation=1";"https://youtu.be/KLJcRiU_HVM";"N/A";"Yes";

Imagine Your Child As A Confident, Strong, Self-Assured Leader
In Fact, Let's Not Imagine. Let's Make It Happen, Together.

First, A Note From Our Instructor:

Hi, my name is Brian Lentz, owner of Professional Karate in Wyoming, MI. I want to take a moment to welcome you to our website and to say THANK YOU for considering Martial Arts for your child. I've taught kids martial arts classes for years and as you can imagine, I've seen every kind of personality you can think of in a child. Rambunctious, shy, defiant, complacent...every child is different, with special gifts to give and challenges to overcome, and I've seen Martial Arts classes help every single one of them find their inner strength, peace, and focus.

We've seen ultra-shy kids burst out of their shell, ADD and ADHD kids learn how to control themselves, socially awkward kids learn how to make and keep friends, and even helped special needs children find a place to fit in and feel accepted. So, what I'll do on this page is tell you a little about what our focus is in our classes, and what methods we use to achieve our results. Take a look at what we do, and see if our philosophy on the Martial Arts mat lines up with your goals as a parent, and if what we teach would be beneficial in your child's life. Again, THANK YOU for considering Martial Arts - it was literally the BEST thing that ever happened to me when I was young, and I think it's possible that it could be the same for your child.
School Pressure, Peer Pressure, Instilling Proper Values, Demanding Extra Curricular Activities
Sound Familiar?

I know what parents like you are facing. I've met thousands of parents just like you and I have to tell you, it's a tough time for kids these days.

Most parents I meet are dealing with these daily 21st Century demands as well as they can, but sometimes the signs of the pressure are obvious. When new students come into our school we often see:

Inability to Focus
It’s usually not malicious, they just have a really hard time focusing.

Difficulty Engaging with Peers or Authority Figures
Parents often see this as a lack of respect (It’s NOT! But it’s still important to overcome).

Lack of Motivation
It’s really hard to be a kid and have people telling you all day what to do. Some kids just shut down and lose their sense of personal motivation.

Crippling Shyness
Eyes on the floor, shoulders down, frozen in fear.

Lack of Follow Through or Perseverance
It’s really hard for a child to see past the “now” and keep at something consistently.

Low Fitness Levels
Childhood Obesity isn’t just a new buzzword. When iPads and Phones are a dime a dozen, getting kids to get off the couch and move is a real challenge.


It Can All Change
Within a Few Weeks, Parents Say They See Their Children Learn:

    Increased Confidence

    Confidence, especially in our Martial Arts classes, is the difference between what a child can actually do vs. what they think they can do. You’ll see them grow more and more confident, and confront new challenges both inside and outside of our school with a sense of drive and purpose.
    The Ability to Defend Themselves Mentally, Emotionally AND Physically

    If they ever need it, your child will absolutely be able to defend themselves physically. But far more importantly, they’ll be able to fend off the mental onslaught of peer pressure and the emotional weight of bullying and unkind behavior. These are things they’ll desperately need as they grow older.
    Soaring Self Esteem

    The most important thing your child will get in our classes is a tremendously positive sense of self. They’ll be able to objectively recognize things they need to improve (homework, family interaction, physical effort) without feeling hopeless, and they’ll take pride in the things they get right without discounting or minimizing their achievements. This will be invaluable for them as adults.
    An Appreciation for Exercise

    If you want kids to stay healthy, they have to enjoy their exercise. Our classes are so much fun, your child will beg to come. They’ll actually love doing pushups, jumping jacks and crunches. They’ll take pride in their improved flexibility and stamina, and they’ll leave class everyday sweating and smiling.

...But How?

How? The Answer isn’t rocket science, and honestly, We feel blessed to have discovered it. It's simple and subtle, but when you see it in person (especially as a parent) It’s almost Magical. ""The Answer"" solves every one of the issues we mentioned, and more.

The class is structured around building the fundamental coordination and body mechanics for moving into our more advanced programs as they get older.  Along with physical fitness, your child will learn respect, discipline, self confidence and how to overcome insecurities. We focus on positive attitudes and personal growth of each individual child. 
You will feel at ease knowing your child is in a safe environment doing things that are constructive and good for them.

Our kids class focuses on our principles of leverage and control. The secret to the success of this program is that we make the lessons so fun that the kids beg for more! We introduce them to jiu-jitsu games that secretly teach them the fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Once they have mastered these jiu-jitsu games, they start focusing on non-violent self-defense techniques that teach children to “neutralize and negotiate” with the bullies. Verbal assertiveness strategies are a major portion of this curriculum. A child needs absolutely no experience to start, and we guarantee a noticeable increase in your child’s confidence within a few weeks!";"http://lansingbjj.com/programs/";"Womens Class: 

In this program, we will teach you how to neutralize the most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Womens class employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents.";"N/A";"http://lansingbjj.com/private-lessons/";"http://lansingbjj.com/class-schedule/";"N/A";"Max Coon";"New students offer: 10-day free trial that includes unlimited access to all classes.";"lansingbjj@yahoo.com";"https://www.facebook.com/Lansingbjj/";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"No";

Thanks to the Gracie Family, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) has proven itself over and over again in competition and on the street. Any martial art that was created by and for the smaller, weaker practioner is one guaranteed to turn the world on its head.

Here at DAMA we emphasize technique and position. Proper technique and good position will dictate the outcome of a fight whether in competition or on the street. BJJ is easy and fun to learn, but takes hard work, discipline and dedication to master.

DAMA is pleased to provide this amazing program to you. Schedule your FREE Intro Class today and see what it is all about!

Kids Classes
Students get weekly Tae Kwon Do instruction, and have the opportunity to test and be awarded belts from Troy Martial Arts. Young students will be motivated to achieve their goals in Tae Kwon Do through a combination of courtesy, patience, and positive Reinforcement. Each student is viewed as an individual. Some students have natural physical talent while others will struggle daily. We work with each student to help them to be the best they can be. No student will ever be compared to another. We do, however, ask each student to always give us their personal best. In her 6th year, Master Tammy Trudeau also teaches at the Schoolhouse Montessori School, located at 3305 Crooks Road, Troy Michigan. 

 Age 5-10 
All Students are instructed at the Troy Martial Arts dojang by certified instructors, who's goal is to help students develop Martial Arts skills, resulting in:

    Strong Focus
    Respect for Self and Others
    High Self-Control
    High Self-Confidence
    Strong Leadership Skills
    Strong Bully Defense Skills
    High Self-Esteem

Young students are taught a specially designed curriculum that perfectly matches their abilities, and will be motivated to achieve their goals in Tae Kwon Do through a combination of courtesy, patience, repitition, and positive reinforcement. Each student is viewed as an individual. Some students have natural physical talent while others will struggle daily. We work with each student to help them to be the best they can be. No student will ever be compared to another. We do, however, ask each student to always give us their personal best.
The Advanced Class moves a little faster, and the students begin to develop the ability to train without hand-holding. For example, the instruction will cover the students curriculum a few times each day, then ask them to continue to practice on their own (or with a group of similar belted students), while the instructor travels the floor and observes and coaches. This teaches the student the responsibility of practicing their taekwondo and to understand they have the ability to train independently. This builds self-confidence and self-esteem for the student. Students will assist fellow students through the curriculum, building amazing leadeship skills, trust, and friendship between the students. We strongly encourage the students to compete at this level.

We offer classes starting weekdays at 4:30pm, 5:20pm, and 6:20pm, depending on how early parents can get them to the Dojang. Can't get there for the 4:30pm class? Bring them to the 5:20 or 6:20 class!

For this young group we teach the RAD Program (Recognize danger, Avoid danger, and Defend against danger). The students are taught to understand that the goal is to recognize and avoid so they never find themselves in a position to defend.

PARENTS: Read on to find out how to raise happier, healthier kids by enrolling them in martial arts classes at The Michigan Aikido & Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy…

 
Attention Parents With Kids Ages 7 and Up!

 
“PARENTS: Here’s How To Stop Worrying About Your Kids And Instead Give Them The Skills They Need To Succeed In School And Life!

But Don’t The Martial Arts Teach Violence?

Let me tell you as both a parent and a martial arts teacher – martial arts don’t teach violence… people, the media, and society teach violence. What we teach here at the Michigan Aikido & Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy is how kids can stay away from violence in a world that’s full of violent images and people.

And when confrontation simply cannot be avoided, we teach our youngest students how to deal with it in the most peaceful and diplomatic manner possible. Our unique curriculum is based on two of the best martial arts for children – Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Aikido. Both arts are known for their effectiveness, and for providing their practitioners with options for resolving violence that use the least amount of force possible.

What this means to you as a parent is that your child will be learning the safest methods of self-protection possible… and they’ll have the option to end a confrontation with words, by escaping, or with the least harmful and yet most effective self-defense methods known to mankind.

Moms and Dads, if this sounds like something you’d like your child to try, read on to find out how you can take advantage of our lowest pricing ever on children’s martial arts classes in the Rochester Hills area.
What Will My Child Learn In Your Martial Arts Program?

When your child attends kids martial arts classes here at The Michigan Aikido & Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy, they’ll learn:
How to avoid the bully by using words and actions tosuperhero kid de-escalate a potentially violent confrontation...
What to do if they're grabbed by an older child or adult...
How to deal with bullies in a way that they'll NEVER be picked on again - and so that their actions are absolutely defensible to the school districts!
Valuable life skills and character building lessons that will bolster their confidence and boost their self-esteem...
And, citizenship lessons that will help your child learn what it means to consider the needs of others, and how to work well in a social group...

Besides Doing Homework and Watching Television…
How Is Your Child Spending Their Time After School?

Like most parents you want to see your child succeed in everything positive in life however there are many more obstacles that kids face in this day in age…

    Peer pressure
    Bullies
    Teasing
    Too much Television
    Playing video games
    Poor grades
    Lack of social skills
    Obesity

Kids develop a sense of self-confidence by becoming good at some activity. With consistent practice and effort they will become good at it.Why Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Is Good For Kids…

    Children are taught how to defend themselves against a realistic attack by using leverage and technique instead of strength.
    Experts agree that grappling is the easiest and safest for your child to learn among the various martial arts disciplines.
Why Our Martial Arts School?

We’ve been involved in our community for over 10 years! We could say we’re the best in the area because we offer so much more than other schools. But we’ll let you make that decision!

    How to avoid peer pressure…
    How to consistently control weight…
    Gains the ability and know how to set and achieve powerful goals…
    Has the self esteem to believe ‘they can do what they put their minds to.’

With the recent national focus on bullying, it is now, more important than ever to prepare our kids who will have to deal with it.

Our KIDS BJJ/BULLY FREE program will give your son or daughter the invaluable tools they need to deal with the verbal and physical aspects of bullying without ever throwing a punch or kick.

The National Education Association estimates nearly 160,000 kids miss school every day in the United States due to fear of intimidation and bullying.   This is likely a conservative estimate since the NEA suggests that less than 15% of kids actually report acts of bullying.

Kids continue to be bullied in school despite efforts to control it. It happens frequently and can have devastating consequences on the child’s school performance as well as their psychological development. Our Kids BJJ/ Bully Free Program is designed to teach kids simple yet effective martial arts skills that are appropriate for them to use. At the same time, our Bully Free Program also stresses development of thinking and interactive skills to prevent actual fights from occurring.

Our Bully Free program has three main objectives:

    Boost Confidence: Bullies are less likely to target self-confident children. As your child sees themselves increasing their skill their confidence will rise. Our experienced instructors instill this confidence by using positive reinforcement and teaching techniques that will neutralize the attack of a larger opponent.
    Increase Awareness: Harassment from bullies can be physical or verbal and delivered at various intensity levels, which each have an appropriate level of response. In each lesson, we focus on teaching your child to recognize and respond to the most common physical and verbal bully behaviors.
    Be Ready: We prepare our students for every common contingency and develop the skills they need to deal with potentially dangerous situations. When your child is prepared he or she will not tolerate harassment from a bully.

Remember, bullying is not a normal part of growing up. Help your child develop the necessary tools to stick up for themselves and others.

CLASS DESCRIPTIONS

Little Grapplers (ages 5-7)

At this age, children are not interested in learning martial arts, but they sure don’t mind “playing” martial arts. In the Little Grapplers class, the kids  “play” many grappling games  in which we secretly teach the children essential self-defense techniques. By playing the fun and challenging grappling games, children develop strong reflexes in the execution of the basic techniques, as they unconsciously learn the foundational principles of leverage and control. Once a child masters the Little Grapplers class, or turns 8 years old, we promote them to the Junior BJJ class.

Junior BJJ (ages 8-12)

Since bullying is most prevalent in this age group, we teach the children in the Junior BJJ classes the essential techniques they must know in order to defend themselves if physically attacked by a bully. The best part about the techniques is that they are totally non-violent, and are only applied in response to the physical aggression of a bully, ensuring that the techniques are never used for the wrong reason. Unlike most martial arts, which are unnecessarily violent, we do not use any punches or kicks. Instead, we teach the children to use leverage to establish control over the bully until help arrives. Once a child learns these techniques, they no longer have to live in fear, and the increased confidence this gives them is the single most effective deterrent to bullies.";"http://metrodetroitbjj.com/programs/";"Womens Self-Defense – [More Content Coming Soon] ";"Muay Thai Kickboxing, Boxing";"N/A";"http://metrodetroitbjj.com/schedule/";"N/A";"Ricardo De La Riva";"N/A";"info@metrodetroitbjj.com";"https://www.facebook.com/MDBJJ/";"http://www.youtube.com/user/metrodetroitbjj";"N/A";"N/A";"Yes";

In some cases, it has even saved lives of people who were attacked when they used what they learned to defend themselves. Children have attained better grades in school. Adults who previously had back problems are now able to do more than they ever could before.

Our team record speak for itselve, our competition team is one of the winningest teams in Michigan. Our philosophy is simple ""train hard...train to be the best"". We want all our students young and old to enjoy and get the most out of this amazing art.

HOW DO WE TRAIN AND TEACH? First and foremost our academy is always kept very clean, and we promote a safe training environment about all. Also we at Detroit Jiu-Jitsu teach BJJ in a very relaxed and non-formal atmosphere. We don´t do any strange rituals and we teach the classes with a lot of humor. Our main goal is to make it fun training with us.

As with any endeavor, Jiu-Jitsu requires patience, determination and time to learn and master. Previous experience in other grappling arts is helpful, but is not a requirement for training. Students will quickly realize there are no secret techniques, easy solutions or quick shortcuts—just plain old-fashioned hard work. Only through hours of repetition, refinement and live sparring can the student retain the information and ingrain the techniques and strategies of Jiu-Jitsu to a state of reflex.

One cannot expect to master Jiu-Jitsu in a few short months. Knowledge of technique does not equal skill. The only way to improve your skills is to acquire enough ""mat time."" Therefore, all students are strongly encouraged to attend class on a regular basis. Imagine how difficult it is to learn a new language. It would be even more difficult if you did not practice often. Beginners to Jiu-Jitsu should expect at least 3 to 5 months of solid training before seeing significant returns in their technique and physical conditioning, and at least 12 months of training to get a solid grasp of the basics. It basically all comes down to your time spent on the mat. Most individuals do not receive their black belts until after 8 to 10 solid years of training—minimum! However, don't be discouraged if this time frame seems long. The color of your belt is unimportant and its only purpose is to hold your pants up. Your focus should be on improving yourself, your skills and having fun!

Our class is structured as follows:

We start each class with calisthenics and stretching, then we teach about 20 min. of basic technique for beginners, then we add to the existing lesson and teach about 20 min. intermediate / advanced technique for those who have been studying longer. That way each student is guaranteed to learn something each class.

All club members are encouraged to supplement their Jiu-Jitsu training outside of class time with stretching, yoga, weight lifting, cardiovascular conditioning and even other martial arts. Fortunately, Muay Thai Kickboxing is offered at our academy. Click HERE to find out more about this martial art. Diversifying your skill sets will not only improve your knowledge base and your physical conditioning, it will also give you insight into other martial art styles—their cultures, philosophies, techniques and strategies. You are then free to incorporate anything you feel is efficient into your own Jiu-Jitsu training. Rather than get bogged down by the debate, ""Who's style is best?"" Jiu-Jitsu practitioners prefer to train hard to constantly improve and refine their skills. This mindset has given Jiu-Jitsu practitioners tremendous freedom to absorb and incorporate any technique or training methodology which improves their skills. Jiu-jitsu means ""flexible"" or ""gentle"" discipline. This principle applies not only to the Jiu-Jitsu practitioner's overall approach towards combat, but also towards the flexibility and free-thinking of the mind. Innovation, creativity and progression are always encouraged. Always seek for more efficient use of your body's resources. Always ask yourself, ""is there a better way?"" Like we say, ""Train hard...train to be the BEST"".";"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/b2/01/03b201bd4fc4f91ca6de3551e684099b.jpg";"http://detroitjiujitsu.com/kids.html";"Best Kids Program in Metro Detroit

We have one of the highest number of female students and instructors compared to most studios in our area.
We are the largest Christ-based studio in the area and have been in business for over 23 years.
All     eastern philosophies and mysticism have been removed and replaced with God’s Word and prayer.  We have prayer at the beginning and end of each class, seminar, and event.
    We have over 10 schools under our Federation ranging from Michigan to Florida, serving over 1000 students.
    We have helped many students with learning disabilities, autism, ADHD, and potential limitations to grow as people and learn how to defend themselves.

The Style

Tang Soo Do is a traditional style of Korean martial arts.  As with other classical martial arts, its purpose is to develop every aspect of the self in order to create a mature personality, which totally integrates one’s intellect, body, emotions, and spirit.  The total integration helps to create a person who is free from inner conflict and who can deal with the outside world in a mature, intelligent, forthright, and virtuous manner.
A literal translation of the word “TANG” is “from the Tang Dynasty of China, which reflects the influence that China had on Korea during the origin of Tang Soo Do (617-907 AD).  The word “SOO” means “open hand” but also implies a defensive hand strike.  The word “DO” means “development of the way of life or art”.  “KYOHOE KWAN’ is translated “Church’s school”, a play of words for the founder Bill Church’s last name, as well as “Church” as the bride of Christ.

Our version of Tang Soo Do KyoHoe Kwan was recognized as a legitimate style variation on October 11, 2008 by the Gospel Martial Arts Union, the World Head of Family Sokeship Council and by several of the world’s greatest martial artists.  This is a worldwide recognition.

Bullyproof is a confidence and character development program for kids and has been proven as an effective countermeasure to bullying as seen on:
    
Every month in the United States, three million children miss school due to fear of bullies. In the Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 13.  
We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one.

"Southfield Martial Arts Institute";"http://www.southfieldmartialarts.com/";" +1 248-569-7030";"29100 Southfield Rd";"Southfield";"MI";48076;;"United States";"The Southfield Martial Arts Institute is the ultimate contemporary training complex. It’s over 15,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility makes it one of the largest and finest martial art schools in the country.

Frequent practice regimes and structured programs go on seven days a week. At Southfield Martial Arts Institute, commitment and discipline are what it is all about. Our school has a diverse make-up of students including children, seniors, laborers and professionals. Everyone works together and helps one another achieve the highest level of martial arts education.
In 1987, Grand Master Willie Adams was inducted into the Karate Hall of Fame. Today, he is head instructor at the Southfield Martial Arts Institute and president of the Karate International Association of Isshinryu. As a 10th degree black belt, Grand Master Adams has been a major figure on the Metro Detroit karate scene for over 40 years.

The highest ranking Isshinryu Master Instructor is Harold Mitchum. He was the senior American on Okinawa with Grandmaster Tatsu Shimabuku. He was made president of Hanshi Shimabuku's association on Okinawa called the Okinawan American Karate Association. Hanshi Mitchum recognized Hanshi Adams as a 10th degree black belt in June of 2008.

Southfield Martial Arts Institute facility includes several other certified black belts, both male and female, who assist in the class. And Grand Master Adams personally oversees the action in every class taught at the school.

Southfield Martial Arts, home of the North American Karate Championship, is located on the northeast corner of Southfield and 12 mile road making it convenient to every city in metro Detroit.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c27.0.160.160/p160x160/1521526_1377758282484033_1287640503_n.jpg?oh=4a5e2b5aa15a35cd07504fc724170cb0&oe=5B307DD5";"http://www.southfieldmartialarts.com/html/youth.html";"For over 40 years, Grand Master Adams has been nurturing children like yours with character building tools found only in karate. No other sport can match them. After enrolling, watch as your child increases in confidence, energy, and spirit. Stand and be dazzled as he/she becomes unstoppable in his quest for:

    Greater academic achievement
    Unshakable self respect
    Increased strength and fitness, in both body and mind

Look at it this way, your child’s first and biggest challenge comes not from “fighting for his rights on the street,” or “beating up the neighborhood bully.” Instead, it comes from battling more sinister forces, your child’s own fears and self doubts: 
    ""I’m not as smart as John.""
    ""I don’t get what my teacher is saying.""
    "" I wish I was as [pretty, tall] as Sally.""
    "" Why does Jim keep calling me a bad name?""
    "" Why can’t I be as popular as Lauryn?""

The question is, how do you get your child to fight these demons? You know the problem; your child has a tough time even telling you she’s haunted by them - never mind how she might conquer them. The good news is I have a proven solution: a program that has already worked for over 3,000 local area children. A series of lessons your child can learn easier than you think. I call it, “Kids With Kick.” Let me tell you it’s secret.

To repeat, martial arts are less about your child learning to fight others, and more about fighting... himself: His innermost fears. Conquer them, and your child unleashes within himself a powerful, unstoppable force; a force that gives him the strength to kick down the doors of his own self doubts; a force that opens your child to the exalting power of values.

In other words, when your child uses the discipline of karate to conquer his fears, he has power to transfer that discipline to all other areas of his life. I know of no other sport that does this better than karate.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://www.southfieldmartialarts.com/html/schedule.html";"N/A";"Harold Mitchum";"N/A";"Smaiadams@aol.com";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"No";"Does Not Have BJJ"

What kind of karate is taught at MAGIC BJJ?

Children in the karate program will be taught traditional Pukang Tang Soo Do (Northern Diamond Chinese Fist Way) – a Korean style of karate that emphasizes both punching and kicking techniques. Pukang Tang Soo Do is a small subset of Tang Soo Do, and was first taught in the United States at Michigan State University in 1962.

 

What will my child learn in karate classes at MAGIC BJJ?

Pukang Tang Soo Do students start by learning basic punches, kicks, and blocks. They then progress to learning forms (prearranged sequences of techniques done without a partner) and two-step sparring (self-defense applications practiced with a partner). As students advance in skill and age, they will participate in supervised, controlled, non-contact sparring to practice their techniques in a more free-form environment. Students will also utilize other training tools such as focus mitts and punching bags to perfect their technique.

Outside of karate technique, however, students will learn discipline and respect for each other. Classes are taught in a formal manner that stresses safety and respect for one’s training partners. Classes are high-energy and are meant to be fun, but students are taught from day one that karate training is a serious endeavor, during which the safety of the class is the primary concern.

Students will also learn self-confidence, not only through the ability to apply self-defense techniques, but through the process of mastering their bodies. The staff at MAGIC BJJ is supportive and encouraging, and works to tailor their instruction to individual needs. This gives the student the opportunity to learn at their own pace, and experience the thrill of mastering a difficult art.

 

Who teaches karate at MAGIC BJJ?

Kid’s karate classes are taught by Mike Mahaffey. Mr. Mahaffey has over 23 years of experience in the martial arts – with 20 of those years in Pukang Tang Soo Do. He holds a first-degree black belt in Taekwondo Chung Do Kwan, a fifth-degree black belt in Pukang Tang Soo Do, and a one-stripe blue belt in Machado Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Mr. Mahaffey is a student of Bruce Henderson, the highest ranking member of the Pukang Tang Soo Do Association. Mr. Mahaffey taught Pukang Tang Soo Do at the MSU Karate Club from 1990 – 2008.

In addition, Mr. Mahaffey is a Limited License Master of Social Work with experience in Michigan’s child welfare system. Mr. Mahaffey is committed to providing a safe, positive environment for his young students to grow and begin their exploration of the martial arts.

 

Can my child earn rank in Pukang Tang Soo Do?

Students will have the opportunity to test for rank within the Pukang Tang Soo Do Association under Mr. Mahaffey. Mr. Mahaffey is able to test adult students up to third-degree black belt, and youth students up to junior black belt. It normally takes several years to earn a black belt in Pukang Tang Soo Do, and students under the age of 16 may be recommended for a junior black belt to recognize exceptional physical ability. Upon reaching the age of 16, a junior black belt will be required to test for a certified adult black belt. Testing fees will apply.

 

What equipment does my child need to participate in the karate program at MAGIC BJJ?

Beginning students need to wear loose clothing that they can move and exercise in. Students train barefoot, in order to both keep the training area clean as well as to facilitate proper foot positioning for karate techniques and balance. A student need not purchase a gi (karate uniform) until after they have tested for their first rank. MAGIC BJJ will be able to facilitate the ordering of gis at this time. As students progress into working with a partner, protective gear (headgear, cups, mouthpieces, shin and instep pads, gloves and boots) will be required. Again, MAGIC BJJ will be able to assist parents with ordering this equipment when it becomes necessary.

Otherwise, students need to come to class with a good attitude, a willingness to learn, and be ready to sweat and have fun!

I entered my first martial arts academy at 4 years old to watch my brother train while sitting on my mother’s lap. This is when I fell in love with the arts. I started my actual training in Taekwondo and Kung Fu at the age of 8 until I was about 14. Entering high school after that I immediately signed up for the wrestling team and fell in love with the world of ground fighting, especially because most fights end up on the ground.

I still practice my wrestling today, but during my time in high school, I wanted to learn how the first UFC fighters, like Royce Gracie, were submitting all their opponents, especially when their opponents were a lot bigger. It was then I realized that Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and wrestling was where my  interest  lay.  Senior year of High School, I walked into the local Judo/BJJ club and started my grappling career. I did tournament after tournament and received my brown belt in Judo within 2 years, including winning California State Judo Championships at the novice level as well as placing and winning several other California tournaments.

When I hit my 20s I still hadn’t moved up in the BJJ world much, which was something I really wanted to do. I didn’t see much opportunity at the Judo/BJJ club I was training at, so I discontinued my training there and entered a 100% BJJ academy called Palm Springs Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Professor Ramon Diaz, who is a 4th degree Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt.

Oh, man, was I glad I did. Professor Diaz and his students took me in like a family member. I had already received a blue belt from the first club but that didn’t matter. No matter what was going on in my life, these guys were there for me, which is one reason why I love Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu so much. Everyone is like a big family.

I’ve always loved the world of competition, so I continued competing in BJJ tournaments through my mid- 20s and into my 30s under Professor Diaz.  I won the IBJJF World Championships at white belt, took 3rd at the Pan American games at white belt, placed 3rd in Nationals at blue belt, won Copa Pacifica at blue belt, and took 3rd at the North American BJJ championships as a purple belt.
​
Currently I’m training to receive my black belt at Freedom Martial Arts in Ludington, Michigan.  With the permission of Professor Diaz, I’ve been granted the privilege to promote Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ranking here in Mason County before receiving my black belt, so if anyone has any interest in learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu while moving up through the ranks, Freedom Martial Arts in Ludington, Michigan is where it’s at!";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c68.66.823.823/s200x200/556857_361561687238688_151006631_n.jpg?_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeHrARbLv6DcPS7NBeWFtUqo6DgI1rStSgX09uVFCrZp7X6yn4OoVTXu-WSH8ltDPm6j8hGjjtARxYTeZcFyQv5x6GXsdHNwAX09tXVbMu8vxg&oh=7e60700bbec2e18139c88d75316fca0d&oe=5B2F9DDF";"https://www.freedommartialarts.net/kids-program.html";"A great activity for kids of all ages!

"World of Self Defense";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/";" +1 612-726-9369";"5406 43rd Ave S";"Minneapolis";"MN";55417;;"United States";"World of Self-Defense/Combat Ju-Jitsu is one of the oldest martial arts schools in the state of Minnesota.

World of Self-Defense in Minneapolis was founded by James Bob Easom. While serving in the US Navy, Bob Easom taught Karate, Judo and Ju-Jitsu (along with with noted AJJF/Hawaiian Ju-Jitsu instructor Bill Beach) at the former Twin Cities/Fort Snelling Naval Air Station, and decided to also offer training to the local civilian community. By 1968, we had a permenant location on Minnehaha Ave in South Minneapolis.

In 1970, Bob Easom was relocated by the US Navy when the Twin Cities Naval Air Station was decommisioned, and World of Self-Defense was taken over by his top Black Belt, Ron Peterson, who had also trained at the Fort Snelling Naval Air Station's Judo & Ju-Jitsu club.

World of Self-Defense was affiliated with the Armed Forces Judo Association, the American Judo and Jujitsu Federation (AJJF) and the Kodenkan Karate Association until the mid-1970's, when World of Self-Defense organized its Kosen Ju-Jitsu association which stressed realistic self-defense and ground grappling. During this time we moved to our current location at 5406 43rd Ave.

World of Self-Defense/Combat Ju-Jitsu is now run by Ron Peterson's son Steve Peterson, who literally grew up with Ju-Jitsu, leading adult classes while still in his teens before eventually taking over the school from his father. Steve has been head instructor for more than 20 years.

In the 1990's, ""Mixed Martial Arts"" events like the UFC increased public awareness of Ju-Jitsu's advantanges, and many students have found our club to be exactly what they were looking for.";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/cjj/Resources/cjjpatch35.gif";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/cjj/kids.html";"Our youth classes are popular with both boys & girls from 5 to 15.

In addition to valuable self-defense skills, students will be able to develop:

    Self-discipline
    Self-confidence
    Respect for self and others
    Focus/Attention
    Good Sportsmanship
    Good coordination & reflexes
    Balance, strength, and agility
    Leadership skills
    Cooperation with others

All in a relaxed, fun, friendly environment!";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/cjj/wsd.html";"Ju-Jitsu for Women's Self-Defense:

While ""Aerobic Kickboxing,"" ""Sport Karate"" and ""Classical"" or ""Traditional"" Martial Arts may be fun activities, they are often not effective against real-life aggressive attacks that ""go to the ground"", and unfortunately that's exactly where attacks on women often end up.

If you are serious about learning effective self-defense, it is absolutely essential that you practice defending against a resisting opponent while you are on the ground as part of your training. That's what we're here for.

Ju-Jitsu training will teach you to maximize your chances on the ground, where you can use leverage and positioning to defend against a larger attacker, instead of relying on upper-body strength. You will learn to use your whole body, and take advantage of your leg strength.

We encourage women to attend our regular adult classes to gain valuable experience working with a wide variety of training partners. There is no substitute for regular training, and you will be amazed at what you will learn in just a few months. Across the country, more and more women are discovering the fun and effectivness of Ju-Jitsu training.

Ju-Jitsu training can be hard work, and you will have a lot of close body contact with your training partner. Some people (and not just women!) are hesitant to learn Ju-Jitsu because the idea of rolling around with strange guys is just too uncomfortable. This close contact is a very important part of the learning process, and once you get to know your fellow students and instructors and learn how the techniques work, it quickly becomes a non-issue.

The more experience you get in Ju-Jitsu class, the less likely you will panic in a real situation where someone is holding you down. You will always be in control of your training experience and we want you to be comfortable and enjoy your training with us.

When you work with our trainers or nutrition coaches, you will experience excellent programming; based on a specific game plan based on your goals, experience and possible injury limitations. Our programming delivers results and is why HPT continues to grow.
The Dream

Higher Power Training began as a dream; the idea to combine all areas of health and fitness to give our clients the best possible fitness and nutritional experience.  Jason left his job as a Personal Training Director in October 2004 and started his own business. The club was more focused on increasing revenue, than getting clients better results or creating the best atmosphere for trainers and clients to work. After much prayer, Jason and Ruth decided on the name Higher Power Training to reflect their deep belief that God is in charge of their lives and vocation.
The Early Years

Jason rented an office and started training his clients in a small facility. Soon, he was selling pharmaceutical grade supplements, hiring trainers to help him train his clients, and asking his wife Ruth for assistance after she was done teaching music for the day. Together they started a plan to build the business and start a facility. They spent months researching geographical locations and sites, the best equipment, how to design locker rooms and a facility, and what amenities are most important to clients. In February 2008, they signed the lease on the current HPT facility and started the build-out process. With the Grand Opening in September, 2008 HPT had 5 trainers and was starting to move from a personal training clientele to include sports performance training, nutrition and detox coaching.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c52.0.200.200/p200x200/407328_10150485946486640_2143863986_n.jpg?oh=450869c60ce19ff5ae7df89146b5ca79&oe=5B317A90";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Monday: 6:00 AM - 7:00 PM

More than just a means of protecting one’s self, self defense classes provide a well rounded exercise regiment and can imbue your child with a strong sense of self confidence.

Childhood is of course the most instructive point in a person’s life, and skills obtained in childhood remain ingrained forever. That’s why Metro Karate & Jiu Jitsu Academy has devoted its services to teaching kids self defense. We believe it’s best to teach young people to protect themselves at an early age, so that the ability to defend one’s self remains permanently etched in their memories.

Our highly trained instructors understand that material taught in self defense classes is often forceful or rough in nature. That’s why Metro Karate & Jiu Jitsu Academy’s instructors take a more hands-on, nurturing approach to teaching. We emphasize defense as merely that: defense, never to be used against another person.

Metro Karate & Jiu Jitsu Academy’s well rounded program draws from a variety of martial arts sources, as well a various philosophies and basic common sense. We want our students to understand that good self defense includes more than physical skill. Our program also emphasizes discipline, restraint, tolerance and respect.";"https://www.edenprairiekarateacademy.com/self_defense_for_women.html";"Crime is something that we all have to deal with, no matter where you live.

Benefits from Every Class.

Action-Packed
Fitness and Exercise.

Action-packed games, activities, and
exercises give kids a great workout
from head to toe.

They get stronger, healthier and more fit within just a couple weeks. These fun exercises also help maintain a healthy weight!

The best part? The fitness is disguised as FUN! All your child will know is that they’re having a blast. But you and I know they’re also getting the exercise they need.


Self-Defense From Strangers, Bullies, and More.

Make no mistake about it: While our classes are tons of fun, we also cover the ""serious"" stuff too.

We teach kids about handling strangers... bullies... and more.

However, the first thing we teach is diplomacy. We give your child the tools they need to ""talk it out"" first. Violence is ALWAYS a last resort!


Powerful Character Development Breeds Discipline, Focus, and Respect.

For thousands of years, martial arts has been one of the best kept secrets for giving kids the skills they need for success in life.

Through inspiring stories and talks, as well as the process of learning the techniques, kids develop amazing traits, like:

Respect, discipline, focus, and goal setting.

I hope your child will never have to use their self-defense skills. But I guarantee these other skills will come in handy EVERY day for the rest of their life.


Fun, Fun, Fun!!!

While kids work hard and train hard in our classes...

... They also smile and laugh a LOT, too!

Who We Are

CrossFit Edina is a 9,000 sq/ft. fitness training and coaching facility equipped with everything you will need to get in the best physical condition possible. We offer group and individual coaching, utilizing the CrossFit methodology. CrossFit workouts are comprised of constantly varied functional movements (like pushing, pulling, squatting, lifting, jumping and running) executed at high intensity.
What We Do

So what does that really mean? It means that at CrossFit Edina you will not find rows of stationary bikes and weight machines. Instead you will find pull-up bars, kettlebells, medicine balls, barbells and wide open space for squatting, running, jumping, climbing, lifting and throwing – moving your body the way it is meant to be moved. It means that all your workouts will be comprised of exercises that mimic movements performed in day-to-day life or sport. We focus on improving functional movements that are necessary and common in your daily activities.

It also means that you will never get bored. With our constantly varied programming you will rarely do the same workout twice in any given year. You will never have to program your own workouts or spend hours in the gym. Instead, each day a workout will be provided for you that is scalable to suit your fitness level. And because our workouts are rarely longer than 40 minutes they can fit into even the busiest schedules.

Our fitness programming aims to improve your capacity in ten recognized fitness domains: cardio-respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance and accuracy. The result is comprehensive physical fitness and restored vitality.
Who We Serve

CrossFit Edina is for you if you:

    Want to get in shape but don’t know how to design a fitness program 
    Dislike the impersonal “GloboGym” environment 
    Have lost interest in your gym routine or get bored with your workouts 
    Think you don’t have time to exercise 
    Are looking to get faster or stronger for your sport 
    Have a profession where your fitness level is paramount to your safety and   the safety of others. 
    Are no longer seeing results with your current training regimen.

Our community at CrossFit Edina is diverse as our workouts; it includes members of our military special forces, full-time moms, doctors, lawyers, police officers, fire fighters, business executives, elite athletes, and retired grandparents. Regardless of your “day job” or your current fitness level, you will benefit from the coaching at CrossFit Edina.";"http://crossfitmn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Crossfit_header-logo.png";"http://crossfitmn.com/fit-kids-and-teens/";"Using activities that kids naturally enjoy and movements that allow Teens to optimize their physical ability, our Fit Kids and Teens programs provide a fitness program that is safe, fun and energetic. A variety of games are used to focus on basic physical skills. Fit Kids and Teens workouts are tailored to the unique needs of children and teens- helping them stay active and healthy.

Our Fit Kids & Teens program is designed for both the young athlete and the Teen looking to start their fitness journey. The focus of the class is very simple: Make them a better athlete. This is relative to the individual. It is not uncommon for High School athletes chasing college scholarships to work alongside someone younger who is just looking to get their bodies moving. The scalability of the program allows them to workout side by side competing and pushing each other in a healthy environment.
At CrossFit Edina, we use a combination of skill practice, workouts and games to build strength and conditioning in children. Our classes include elements of gymnastics, weight lifting, body weight movements and plyometrics.

Specifically, our Fit Kids and Teens programs teaches the 10 General Physical Skills. These skills are the base for any sport or discipline your child may pursue. 
The 10 General Physical Skills

    Cardiovascular Endurance – Can you get enough oxygen to your body? 
    Stamina – Can you get enough energy to your muscles? 
    Strength – How much can you lift? 
    Flexibility – Can you touch your toes? 
    Power – How much work can you do in the least time? 
    Speed – How fast can you go? 
    Coordination – Can you pat your head and rub your stomach? 
    Accuracy – Can you kick a soccer ball into the net? 
    Agility – How quickly can you change direction? 
    Balance – Can you stand on one foot? With your eyes shut?

In addition to learning new skills, you will notice your child makes better food choices, is more focused in school, transitions to new sports easier and has a reduced risk of sport-related injury.

Our goal is to help children become the best version of themselves possible. The tool we use is physical fitness, but our philosophy is that training CrossFit increases quality of life, both inside and outside the gym. We are committed to teaching children to become successful leaders while promoting the importance of health and fitness for a lifetime in a safe and positive learning environment.
Our Fit Kids and Teens learn not only basic physical skills, but also social skills and confidence. Kids and Teens learn fundamental movements including squats, push-ups, pull ups, climbing, jumping, running, weight lifting basics, stretching and elementary gymnastic movements.

More importantly, your child will also learn to follow directions, listen, communicate, and play with others. Every class includes game play and positive reinforcement. Your child’s confidence, both physically and mentally, will grow with each class.

We also focus on leadership skills. As children progress through the program, they will be asked to model movements, lead exercises, and demonstrate an ability to verbally explain exercises while assisting newer, younger students in class.
At CrossFit Edina, our Fit Kids and Teens program is designed for EVERY child to experience and celebrate progress. As you watch your child grow in ability and confidence, they will also learn that hard work results in success.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://crossfitmn.com/class-schedule/";"N/A";"Damian Hirtz";"1 free trial class offer!";"info@crossfitmn.com";"https://www.facebook.com/CrossFitMinnesota/";"http://www.youtube.com/crossfitmn";"N/A";"N/A";"No";

Excel's Kidz 'n Power Taekwondo training programs for 5 to 12 year-olds provide a list of underlying benefits and achievements:
Fitness and Coordination: Martial Arts challenges the entire body. It develops coordination, body awareness, balance, agility, and strength, and stamina.

Safety: In cooperation with AmberAlert.com, Excel-Lifeforce and the ATA are the authorized training facilities for abduction defense and street safety training.
Better Grades: Developing personal skills is a major part of the program. We stress following directions, paying attention in class, respecting those teaching, and becoming an active participant.
Self-Confidence: Every child is a winner. We use positive reinforcement to help them achieve their goals during their training.

Jiu Jitsu
Excel-Lifeforce is also a Certified Gracie Bullyproof training center as featured on CNN, NBC News, and Oprah. We teach negotiate – report – defend as a method for children to feel confident in facing bullies or peer group pressure.

XMA
Children can develop exceptional composure, agility, and confidence by modifying their traditional skills, adding gymnastic technique and including background music as part of training in performance martial arts. As a licensed Xtreme Martial Arts academy, Excel has been home to many national performance teams including a World Champion XMA Demo Group.";"http://www.woodburymartialarts.com/women.php";"Fitness

Songahm Taekwondo training allows you to get in shape and stay in shape at your own pace. The principles of traditional martial arts training are based on the design of your body. For power, we help you develop the larger, powerful muscles of your core. The speed of taekwondo technique comes from the fast, agile muscles of your arms and legs.

Self-Defense
When the speed and power developed through taekwondo, or the leverage, joint and pressure tactics of Gracie Jiu Jitsu are used in self-defense against the vulnerable parts of an attacker's body, a woman can be remarkably efficient against a much larger opponent. Just knowing you can defend yourself gives your confidence, and confidence is often enough to deter potential attackers.
 
Self-Confidence

Self-confidence doesn't come naturally for many people, but it can be developed over time by setting reasonable goals and attaining them. The self-confidence that results from taekwondo training will carry over into all aspects of your life.

We don’t charge for the initial test, and we don’t charge for re-tests.

By setting your own goals, working towards them, and accomplishing them each and every day it becomes more than just a workout or a martial art, it becomes a personal building session.

Martial Arts requires the ability to focus on the skill at hand for long periods of time. This focus will help anyone, regardless of age, in their everyday life. Studies show that exercise will improve cognitive functions and students engaging in Martial Arts can get better grades.

If you’re looking for a way to develop more focus, work more efficiently in the workplace (or school), and have a more optimistic view, then Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is for you.

Is This Karate?

No.  Our kids classes are a mixture of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai Kickboxing.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a ground fighting art, similar to wrestling (and we know how much kids LOVE wrestling), but with submission holds.  This is great for kids because they can learn to defend themselves WITHOUT getting hit, and also without hurting someone else.  So when the school yard bully comes around, your child will be able to stop that bully and stay safe, without hurting the bully either.

Muay Thai is a form of kickboxing that is highly effect and FUN!  Your child will have a blast learning to punch and kick while also learning to defend themselves and also build up their confidence.

Will My Child Get Hurt?

Our main concern is safety. Our Kids Martial Arts classes are extremely safe and will help ensure your child stays in tip top condition as they are learning how to defend themselves. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a ground fighting art so there are no strikers, so no worries of your child getting a concussion or any other nasty bumps.

What are the benefits?

    Better focus and a better attitude overall
    Better grades in school
    Learn how to defend themselves should they ever need to
    Improved confidence and self esteem
    Make new friends and learn how to socialize with new people
    Get exercise to stay healthy and fit
    Learn the value of exercise and hard work at a young age
    Have fun!

Give your child the gift of fitness.

Allow your kids the opportunity to learn the joys of fitness and being healthy. Building these tendencies at a young age can mean the difference between a long, healthy life, or a life of obesity and medical troubles.  Exercise is something that, if not learned at a young age, is often overlooked and can cause health problems later in life. Get your kids on the right track early teach them how important it is to take care of their health.

We are a community of caring instructors and parents who invest themselves in our students' lives to see them succeed. We believe in meeting our students where they are at, with no ego and a supportive approach to guide our students to their full potential. 
Fusion was founded in Eagan, Minnesota in 1994 with a mission to change lives and develop leaders in our community through martial arts. Being a part of the Eagan community for over 20 years has given us the valuable experience of teaching thousands of students and perfecting our approach to martial arts leadership education. We teach real martial arts in our traditional Taekwondo and Fusion Fit classes with a high standard of excellence for our students' performance. 

Fusion Martial Arts is independently owned and operated, and our instructors are certified by the American Taekwondo Association (ATA).

At Fusion Martial Arts we want to provide your child with a strong foundation of listening skills, focus, discipline, and confidence to help them prepare for success in the classroom and in life. Unlike other youth activities, we focus on your child as an individual, and work side-by-side with you as a parent to unlock your child’s full potential. 
Our Philosophy

Fun first! Kids learn best through play. That's why we believe in ""edutainment"". Your child will learn the most when he or she is having fun. Our energetic instructors love working with kids and every class includes martial arts drills and skills to ensure that your child is engaged every moment. Of course to have fun, safety must be #1. That's why we encourage a low student to instructor ratio, appropriate partner pairing and only the best, martial arts specific safety mats and training equipment. We take our commitment to creating a safe and inspiring learning environment even further, which is why our instructors use POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT when giving correction. Not only does it make learning more enjoyable, but it's simply more effective. You won't find barking drill sergeants or ego-driven senseis here.  
It's About Life Skills

At Fusion Martial Arts, respect, confidence, discipline, honesty and leadership are more than lofty words on motivational posters. Anyone can learn to kick and punch, but from the very first FREE introductory lesson, we strive to create Black Belt Leaders; in other words children who are:


- Respectful to parents and teachers
- Confident to raise their hand in school and stand up to peer pressure
- Honest to admit mistakes and learn from them
- Self disciplined to make the right choice even when it's not the easy thing to do, whether it's doing homework without complaint, eating healthy foods or going to a teacher instead of hitting back

Martial Arts is the tool by which we can help build a strong foundation for all of life. We know that not every child grows up to be Bruce Lee, but every child needs teachers and coaches to reinforce positive habits and behaviors.
Bully Proof: Keeping Kids Safe

Sticks and stones couldn't be further from the truth. Sadly, parents and teachers

often fail to realize that bullying rarely begins with physical violence, but usually

starts out with seemingly innocuous emotional and verbal teasing or harassment.

Once a child loses confidence due to bullying, his or her ability to make friends

and try new things is compromised and the risk of physical harm escalates.

That's why we are so adamant about building confidence in addition to teaching

practical self-protection techniques. We want your child to develop the strength

to combat bullying and negative peer pressure even when you're not around. 


Despite years spent coaching parents and children through difficult bullying

situations, we can't help but share the initial anger every parent experiences

when they find their child is the victim of bullying. Yet it is vital to remember it's

not about what you do for your child, it's what you teach them to do for themselves. You can't ""give"" a child confidence by trying to bolster their self-esteem; rather children must build confidence for themselves by overcoming obstacles in a safe and supportive environment. Fusion Martial Arts' curriculum is designed to encourage new ""I did it!"" experiences with every class. Click here to get started.

Kid-Fit

Many children are spending less time exercising and more time in front of the TV, computer, or video-game console. And today's busy families have fewer free moments to prepare nutritious, home-cooked meals. From fast food to electronics, quick and easy is the reality for many people in the new millennium. Add to this the number of school districts that have reduced funding for sports and PE programs to meet budget constraints and it's no surprise that 1 out of 3 kids are now considered overweight or obese.

 

We take our mission to combat obesity seriously. Our engaging and dynamic classes get children excited about moving their bodies and develop a life-long joy for sports and exercise. Furthermore, our instructors teach your child the discipline to make the right choices for their health, even when it's not easy. Physiologically, the beauty of martial arts lies in the simple fact that every technique builds balance, agility and core muscle strength making it an ideal foundational exercise activity for anyone. Martial Arts is all about ""bilateral movement,"" a fancy term fitness specialists use to describe the difference between sport-specific motions like swinging a baseball bat or kicking a soccer ball and those of martial arts which emphasize ambidextrous development of the body.

 

We believe nothing is more vital than establishing proper eating and exercise

habits early in life. We also know that ultimately helping kids lead healthy

lifestyles begins with parents who lead by example. Preventing kids from 

becoming overweight means adapting the way your family eats and exercises,

and how you spend time together. Could your example use some help? Our

Fusion Fit Classes will help you get in fighting shape. We also offer family

classes every day of the week so if you haven't yet considered training with

your child be sure to check out our fantastic family programs.

Our Philosophy

Start where you are. We know that walking into a typical martial arts school feels about as comfortable as entering a saloon in an old western. It can be overwhelming and maybe downright scary. Not at Fusion Martial Arts. Whether you have years of training experience or have never seen a Kung Fu film, we want to make your first session with Fusion as painless as possible. Starting with your FREE introductory lesson, our instructors will meet you where you are today, help you set realistic goals for your training and guide you toward a program that's right for you. We know that the first step is always the hardest. We're here to help. Who knows? It may be the beginning of something great! 
Safety First

Martial arts is not about hurting people. It's about developing our mental and physical strengths, getting fit, and learning self defense skills. No one wants to get hurt when they are trying to learn new skills. That's why we encourage a low student to instructor ratio, offer beginners-only classes, encourage appropriate partner pairing and only offer the best martial arts-specific mats and training equipment. We are committed to helping you learn the proper form first, at your own pace. We take our commitment to safe learning seriously, and offer positive reinforcement when giving correction. It makes learning more enjoyable and it's more effective. You won't find anyone yelling at you here. 
You Have a Life. Maybe Kids Too?

Family, work, school... we all have lots of commitments. That's why our training programs are designed for maximum flexibility. You don't have to join a monastery to start appreciating the benefits of martial arts training, you just have to join Fusion.

Train Martial Arts As A Family Or Drop Your Children Off!

The Family Mixed Martial Arts Program provides similar training as our adult MMA program, however, it is optimized for children & young teenagers. It also allows parents to train in the same class as their children if they want to. Instructors pair adults with adults, and children with children. Only those adults with their own children in the class are allowed to participate.

However, parents have the option of just watching the classes, or simply dropping off their children until class is over. We understand family schedules need to be flexible, so attend as many or as few classes as you like every week!

Our Kids Martial Arts Teaches Important Life Skills!

This class provides a friendly, safe and enjoyable format of comprehensive training for children at least 7 years old and above. The training has a very strong emphasis on safety.
Every parent wants the best for their children, and to prepare them for all the challenges that they will face in the future. Effective self-defense skills are certainly important in today’s world full of undesirable people.  However, the long term benefits of our children’s curriculum provides much more than just self-defense skills.

Our program develops essential skills and attitudes in preparation for the many physical and psychological challenges they will face during the rest of their lives! The following key traits will have a massive impact on their future success and happiness…

    The confidence & self-esteem to take on new challenges, expect the best from themselves, and to ignore negative peer pressure, drugs, and other unhealthy influences.

    The habit of being physically active and fit, and the self esteem fitness provides both socially and in athletics. 
       
    The habit of setting and achieving goals, and balancing work (training) and play (fun time).

    The focus and discipline to keep going and succeed in whatever they have decided to achieve. Overcoming the habit of quitting, and turning the fear of failure into a fun process of learning.
       
    Social skills including communication, listening, giving and receiving, courtesy and respect.
       
    Leadership skills (at advanced levels) including taking responsibility, being organized, being a good example, speaking to and leading a group.

    Real self defense skills that provide confidence and, if needed, skills for staying safe if they have to deal with school yard bullies, excessive peer pressure, or other situations that require real self-defense skills.
       
    Honor, which is simply doing what is right. This includes knowing how to properly use the martial art training, and most importantly, knowing when NOT to use it and simply walk away. Also, confidence should not produce arrogance, but the ability to show respect to others, and to help others.

Most parents do everything they can to teach these life skills to their children. It’s not an easy task because this type of education is not found in our schools. Schools tend to focus on knowledge for a career, not skills for a life. It’s not found on our football, soccer or little league fields either. Team sports tend to focus on how to win a game, not how to win in life. Teaching your child the life skills of goal setting, focus, discipline, confidence, courtesy and honor, at a young age, will have a massive impact on the level of success and happiness he or she enjoys in later life.

What We Do

We takes a somewhat  old school approach to training. 

Fighting and competition is hard.

We train harder.

 The official raising your hand after a fight is not where winners are made.  Fights are won in the gym long before the actual competition.  Winners are made, not born.  They are made through the hours of hard work put in and the blood, sweat, and tears shed in the gym.  There is no substitute for hard work as it applies to Mixed Martial Arts. we are looking for people with the drive necessary to put in those hours to become those champions of tomorrow, and do it all with a smile, even a broken one.

My name is Jack Wenenn and I am the owner of Pride Martial Arts. When I began my martial arts journey, the positive impact it had on my life was remarkable. It was always my dream to some day own my own school and when I opened Pride Martial Arts in 2005, I made a commitment to our community in Gladstone & Kansas City to create an enjoyable environment for students to improve their fitness while building confidence they can carry into their everyday lives.

Imagine yourself or your child as a stronger, more confident individual in your best physical and mental shape. I want to personally invite you to take advantage of our introductory trial offer and turn that vision into a reality.

MARTIAL ARTS IS NOT JUST KICKS AND PUNCHES!

We teach all our members to focus on and be present in the moment - and in this age of distractions and sensory overload, this is a skill which returns immediate results in all aspects one's life.  Here are some interesting facts about our Martial Arts School:

    Our members are from all walks of life; we have students, attorneys, doctors, engineers, military and law enforcement all training in a fun, team oriented family environment.
     
    We have kids that have been training for years that leave to top colleges and universities in the country, thanks in part to the discipline and focus on hard work they learned through martial arts.  This is something we take a great amount of pride in. 
     
    There are always new generations of individuals and families coming in to pursue the ongoing legacy.  It is a tradition in martial arts to pass down the knowledge one receives in their training and many students become instructors, often ending up owning their own schools.  

It is our goal to inspire strength, discipline, confidence and focus in our students, to help them discover the leader that is within them.  I believe every child has the potential to be a leader, they just need someone to believe in them. As a parent myself, I understand the challenges of raising a confident and focused child in an age where there are more distractions than ever.

And while the kids have their fun, our adult program is second to none.  From traditional martial arts to more modern self-defense styles, there is something for everyone at Pride Martial Arts.  If you are looking to burn major calories, learn self-defense moves and get in the best shape of your life, you must come and check out our adult program.

Imagine yourself as a stronger, more confident individual in the best shape of your life. I want to personally invite you to take advantage of our introductory trial offer, and turn that vision into a reality.  

It would be a privilege to meet you and your child to have them step into the wonderful world of martial arts.";"https://pridekarategladstone.com/upload/Pride-Martial-Arts1.png";"https://pridekarategladstone.com/programs/children-programs/karate-for-kids";"Karate for Kids at Pride Martial Arts in Gladstone & Kansas City

ATA Karate For Kids is a specialized program created exclusively for children. The Karate for Kids program includes two age groups, both of which teach the fundamentals of martial arts for kids. Pre-school karate for kids classes are for children ages 3-6 and the karate for kids classes for children ages 7 through 12. The foundation of the martial arts ATA curriculum is the ongoing ATA review and development of life-skills such as positive mental attitude, high goal-setting, perseverance, self-control and confidence.

Karate For Kids training is designed to be fun and fulfilling for each student. This is because Taekwondo is an individual activity rather than a team sport. Therefore every student is an active and valuable participant in class. They work out with kids their own age and size under well-supervised conditions, and progress at their own pace.

Through personal growth and achievement, students advance with a martial arts belt rank but are also acknowledged for outstanding performance in martial arts class, school, home, special events, or in tournament competition.";"https://pridekarategladstone.com/programs/adult-programs/womens-kickboxing";"World Class Fitness Instruction, Self Defense Training and a Ton of Fun – You’ll get it All!

YOUNG WARRIORS
(Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu)

The School's Young Warrior's Program is built to impress, not only the physical skills of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and self defense aspects of Krav Maga on the youth of Kansas City. The program is also built to instill the life skills of discipline, strength, honor, courage and confidence in our future leaders.

Kids ages 5 -15 can come join our program and start off with BJJ Instructor, Derek Bohi. In this class your child will learn the basics of conditioning and movement needed to practice the art. As progress is made, the children will be taught the fundamentals as well as methods needed to bring home the gold in a tournament.

Once evaluated by the instructors, your child can then begin the Kids Krav class. Taught by Krav Maga instructor Frass Azab, the class will be a lesson in discipline and self defense, focusing on the principles of awareness and conflict prevention.

This program is designed to pair the classes and build skills which will spread to all aspects of your child's life. If you are interested, we offer your child one drop in visit and an open invitation to join our family!

We are a progressive martial arts school that focuses on the education and development of its students abilities in martial arts. Our mission is to develop each individual's confidence, self esteem, and character through the practice of martial arts.

Our classes have helped numerous people with balance, coordination, and confidence that transfers to other activities as well.

He currently holds the rank of 4th degree Black Belt in Judo awards by Sensei Steve Scott. Sensei Marble has been training students in the art of Judo for many years now. Several of his students over the years have metaled in the Jr. Olympics and even the Jr. US Open Judo Championships.

Judo is a martial art that was derived directly from Japanese Jujitsu. It was founded by Dr. Jigoro Kano in 1882. This art focuses on throwing and grappling techniques with its principals being to utilize maximum efficiency and mutual benefit and welfare. Dr. Kano created this art as a sport that would allow practitioners to practice in a fun way and perfect their skills in competition. From a world wide perspective, Judo is one of the most popular sports in the world. It is a required class in Japanese schools and its popularity throughout Europe is tremendous. In 1964 Judo was included in the Olympic games and still is to this day. Our school offers Judo programs for both Kids (Jiu-Jitsu yellow belt and up) and Adults.
It is important for our students and prospective students to understand that our Judo program assumes that you are also participating in our Jiu-Jitsu program.  We have an exceptional Brazilian jiu-jitsu program here at our school.  In our Judo classes, we work on the throwing techniques of Judo.  We know that you will get incredible grappling practice to support your throwing skills in our Jiu-Jitsu classes.  

Over the years, the sport aspect of Judo has changed significantly (the rules have changed).  For example, one new rule is that you can no longer grab the legs in judo competition.  In my opinion, several of these new rules such as this one severely limit the use of Judo as an actual martial art.   Furthermore, many of our students compete in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu competitions as well as other grappling competitions that do not impose these limiting rules.  Our students need to know how to defend leg attacks and such, therefore we still practice them.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"https://myjujitsuschool.perfectmind.com/SocialSite/schedule";"Monday: 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM

Dear Parent:

My name is France Pruter and I am the Head Instructor of one of the most Successful Children's Martial Arts Programs in the Kansas City area.   For over 25 years I have been teaching children just like yours the benefits of Taekwondo Martial Arts.   It has been incredibly rewarding watching their lives change as they develop the skills necessary to be successful in Life.  If you read on I am going to tell your 4 different stories about children whose lives have been changed through Taekwondo at PST and how their parents couldn't be happier.

Story #1 ""I asked you 5 times already""Brandon never gets anything done the first time, whether its ""clean your"", ""do your homework"", “ let the dog out"", it just never gets done.  His parents spend lots of energy and tons of time just getting him to do the smallest of tasks.   As a result  there is a lot of intense emotion in the home.

""Story #2 the ADD Child""Sam could never control himself in school.   His school teacherthought he was just a ""wild"" child.  The other children in his class would get distracted by him and they would have a hard time concentrating too.  He was intelligent, just as intelligent as they come but he couldn't focus for the life of him.  

If only he could concentrate his energy and do one thing at a time. 

Story #3 the Easy Going Child""It wasn't like Lexi wasn't intelligent, she was.  She just never had passion for anything and was just a little to ""easy going.""  She never applied herself to anything.   As a result her school grades suffered, she could easily make A's but she just didn't pay attention.  

She needed something that would wake her up and help her reach her true potential.

and last but not least......

""Story #4: the Bullied Child""School can be really tough on kids, especially if your son or daughter isn't very confident with themselves. So was the case of Noah.   Noah was a really good kid who tried to keep tohimself and be a could student.  But the Bully in the school would just not leave him alone, 

Noah did not have the confidence to stand up for himself.


There are honestly countless other benefits children receive from Taekwondo Martial Arts. 

But rather then me telling you about them just read what the parents of some of our Taekwondo Martial Arts Children say....“A massive change, in only 3 short weeks…”

Chase has a bit of an anger problem, but I have already noticed a positive change.   He's showing more respect to me, and his teachers cannot believe He calls them  ""sir"" and m'am"".  No other child in his class shows their teachers as much respect.

It really makes me feel great, and I believe I have done a great thing for myself and my child by enrolling him in his Taekwondo Martial Arts class..

Mary Preston (Chase's Mom)

“This is Amazing! She did her homework the first time I asked!”Hey, I just wanted to tell you that Ashley did her homework today the first time I asked her to! I’m still in awe! I know it is because of what she learned in Taekwondo Martial Arts class.  You have put together an amazing program. Thank you so much.

Sincerely,

- Anne Williams
(Ashley's mom)

“That bully backed down after all”When Austin got off the school bus today and got into the car, he could not stop talking about how he stood up to the bully who had been picking on him for months!  He said the bully backed down, and everyone in class saw it!  I got so choked up that I almost had tears.  Austin asked what was wrong and  I just told him I was so proud of him.

Thank you

- Rodney McSpadden (Zekes Dad)

“She just can not wait to get to Taekwondo Martial Arts Class…”At first I was not sure if Maliia would like Taekwondo Martial Arts.  After all, she’s only 5, so she never really completes anything.

Wow was I wrong! She gets really upset if we ever have to miss a taekwondo class.  And I she is more focused, more attentive, and just all around happier after starting this program.

- Stephanie Shippmen (Maliia's Mom)A Gold Medal Solution

In just a few short weeks you will start to see the change in your child..................You will see...........

✔Clearer FocusIn Taekwondo Martial Arts we have our children do one task at a time.  They may do that one task for 30 to 60 seconds, but in that 30 to 60 seconds that is the only task that they focus on.  

Then the better and better they get at focusing on that one task we will start to increase the time of that activity.   They never get bored or ""hot feet"".  Before you know it they can take that skill and use it in there home work, chores, conversation or what ever they set their mind to. on.

✔Task Oriented and Goal Setting

From the very first day your child begins Taekwondo Martial Arts they set goals and accomplish them.  The more they succeed the more ambitious they become.

Eventually he learns to set more important and higher goals.  He learns to go after them with everything that he has.   He learns to process think.  In other words if I do this I get that, process thinking is the key to success in academics.  Because of this children who do Taekwondo Martial Arts are more likely to succeed at what ever they do. 

 A recent study showed that 63% of Black Belts become college graduates.

✔Increased Attention Span

Parents of children with trouble paying attention breathe sighs of relief after just after several short weeks.  That's because in Taekwondo Martial Arts we teach children to look adults in the eyes when they are being spoken to.  We teach them that this is how you show adults that you are listening and paying attention.  After several short weeks, children naturally begin doing this at home and in their class rooms at school.  Parents and teachers are amazed when they see the changes.  They can not believe how much better their children pay attention.✔ Children Learn Team Work

In Taekwondo Martial Arts we have just a few very simple rules.   One of those rules is that when a child is asked to do something, he does it the first time.

We never yell at the children if they don't do this.  But every child does it because he sees the other children in the class doing it too.  He just wants to make friends and be a part of the group.  It is usually just a matter of several weeks before children start doing this at home too.  Parents have thanked me many times for this positive change in their child.  For parents whose children have a hard time following directions this is a blessing.

✔Increased self-respect 

When it comes to bullies children in Taekwondo Martial Arts do not back down.  They have the confidence to look a bully in the eye and stand their ground.

This is what really almost always happens.  The bully get scared and backs down.  It happens nine out of 10 times.   For the one out of ten the bully does not back down your child has the tools to fight for himself.  And if he needs to he will be able to get away and seek and adult authority.  Most problems can be talked through but just in case words don't work your child will have the tools to defend himself.

✔ Weight ""kids need to lose weight too""It is easy these days for children to not exercise. As a result, many children experience weight problems at very young ages.

✔Taekwondo Martial Arts is an amazing form of exercise and a perfect way to improve a child's Athleticism  

Your child will be active the entire time. But there is  no pressure on him to do anything he can not.  We will encourage him to do his best – but this isn’t boot camp or anything.  Most importantly your child will have tons of fun!

Just like most parents I am sure you have some important questions.  The most common questions that I have answered over the last 25 years are listed below but if you have any others don't hesitate to give me a call 816-525-4300.

“Can Taekwondo Martial Arts make my child violent?”

A huge misconception a lot of people have about martial arts is that it will make children more violent.  At PTMAF we believe most difficult situations can be diffused  using verbal tactics and self control.  Unfortunetely bullies do exist in our classrooms, playgrounds, neighborhoods, workplaces, and in public places.   At PTMAF our students will learn the proper time to use verbal strategy and diffuse the situation or effective self-defense techniques to escape to safety.“My Child is not Athletic, Can he do Taekwondo Martial Arts?""

It's important for young children to develop a variety of fundamental skills to help them become good general athletes.  This is called multilateral development, and it is one of the most important training principles practiced at our school.  Our multilateral training program focuses on overall athletic development along with acquiring specific Taekwondo Martial Arts skills.  To go straight to the point ""We make athletes.”

""Will my Child have a difficult time doing Taekwondo Martial Arts?”

No, most children just jump right in and go.  We teach in a very positive and encouraging way so that the children feel really good about themselves.  We also have several theories to learning.  The first is whole part whole, this is how children learn the best.  The teaching is done naturally while they are doing the activity and is not forced.  This way the child gets it when he gets it and never feels stress.   The other is part, part, whole which we teach at an older age when the children are able to understand concepts.  We teach that way in our PTMAF Basic classes.“What age is appropriate for Taekwondo Martial Arts at PTMAF?”

You can never be to old, but sometimes you can be to young.   We recommend no younger then 4.  If your not sure just bring your child in for a free class.

“Will my child get hurt?”

Your child's safety is of our highest concern.  All contact is age appropriate and closely monitored by our highly trained staff.  “Will my child have fun? Will he want to stick it out, I mean stick with the program?”

Your child will have a blast and beg to come to class.  Sticking with the program is a concern of a lot of parents.  We really don't know until we try it.

“Is Taekwondo Martial Arts just for boys? Or can my girl take Taekwondo Martial Arts too?”

We have a lot of girls and they love it.

Sching Da Do “The New Way” is a child-oriented version of Jeet Kune Do to teach life skills, stranger danger and to stop bullying. True martial arts teaches children not to fight but how to stay away from dangerous behavior, stay calm in dangerous situations and control their own force onto others. Independent studies show that children who study martial arts develop respect, goal oriented behavior, academic discipline, success and self-confidence.

How can martial arts help my child?

Great question!

First off, there are no bench sitters, every child participates and is judged not against others but against their own potential.

Secondly, martial arts are built on the concept of setting children up for success by giving them a series of realistic, short term goals that they can attain relatively quickly while keeping them focused on an exciting, long term goal like black belt. Each time they experience success, their confidence improves until they internalize that with hard work and dedication, they can accomplish just about anything.

And finally, by consistently participating in physical and fitness-oriented activities, they become more physically and mentally coordinated and comfortable with themselves.

Also, bullying has been a growing problem with today’s youth and martial arts training at Shepherd-Warrior Martial Arts can help children at either end of this issue. The child who is being bullied might lack confidence or self-respect – martial arts can help with both. Bullies typically lack confidence or have aggressive tendencies and martial arts helps with self-control and behavior issues.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"https://shepherdwarriormartialarts.com/schedule/";"Monday: 4:00 PM - 9:00 PM

His family has had a long tradition of fighters including his great grandfather Mickey Finn, the legendary bare knuckle champion of Ireland. Mick began Martial Arts training at the age of 7.

From 1980 to 1985 Mick went undefeated and become the Irish Kickboxing Champion. For three of those years Mick was forced to fight in the adult divisions, even though he had not met his majority. His tournament and fight schedule allowed him to travel much of Northern Europe.

On December 6th, 1986 at the age of 18 Mick made the decision to immigrate to the United States. He attended Bellevue University full time until 1988 when a position opened up at Saint Joseph Center for Mental Health where he became the Fitness coordinator for the hospital, it’s patients and staff. He also opened his first Martial Arts school in the same year called The Midwest fighting Arts Academy.

In 1989 he met one of his childhood goals—being recognized as one the best active fighters in the world. He was ranked the number one welterweight fighter in the IKKC World rankings by Denver based World promoter Vern Stephenson, and later that year one his first World Title in Muay Thai.

In September 1994, Mick won his second World title. The IKBO (International Kickboxing Organization ) based out of Emmen, Holland and run by Mr. Fred Royers.

On April 25th, 1996 Mick was appointed Head Coach of the United States Muay Thai Team. In May of that year Mick traveled with the team to Thailand to train and compete in the Princes Cup World Championship.

After returning from Thailand, Mick began to spend more time perfecting his Jui Jitsu and Grappling skills. Mick was introduced to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu by his friends Scott Thompson and R.J Nebe who were the first blue belts in the midwest under the legendary Rickson Gracie. Renzo Gracie came to Omaha to train with Mick at the gym as did John Lewis and Igor Zinoviev.

In 1998 Mick wanted to test his new found skills of grappling and No Holds Barred fighting with a real competition and won the Budokai Bare Knuckle Challenge in Springfield Missouri. Also in 1998, Mick won the Grand Championship Belt at Bas Rutten’s U.S. Open Jui Jitsu/ Tough Man Tournament in Denver, Colorado. His last full contact fight was in Beijing China in 1999 as part of the first professional mixed martial arts fight ever done in China.

Since retiring from competition Mick has devoted his energies to continuing his advancement as a Martial Artist and a coach. He currently holds the rank of Brown Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under Master Fabio Santos who is one of the highest ranking students of Rickson Gracie. He strives to teach people the life’s lessons he has learned from years of constantly challenging and pushing himself to be the best. The odds have always been stacked against him. From being blind in one eye, to immigrating to the U.S. at the age of 18, unsure of what his future in this country would hold. Mick has faced all these challenges with the courage and determination of a modern day warrior. . He is currently the head coach of the National amateur Mixed Martial Arts team and has trained more National champions than any other coach in the United States. To date, he has coached 37 National Champions and cornered 6 World Champions. His seminars and fighter coaching sessions and methods are among the best in the world. He has lived his life by the Samurai maxim “everything, everybody, outside of myself is my teacher”.";"http://www.mickdoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/md_logo.png";"http://www.mickdoyle.com/programs/";"YOUTH PROGRAM

Our youth program is based on the teachings and drills of Gan Teora.  The kids are taught that learning Martial arts is a big responsibility as they are learning skills that could save their lives, and that it is not something which you show off or bully others with.  Through the disciplined training, the child will develop self-defense, self-discipline, and self-respect.  The children progress through a belt system but unlike some Martial Arts schools we do not believe that a child or parent should be bound to a long term contract that promises a black belt at the end of a year or two.  Our Black Belts are the finest examples of men and women that you will find.  They are well-rounded martial artists who have recognized the importance of a healthy lifestyle and will demonstrate leadership and maturity in everything that they do.  They train here because they want to, not because they are under obligation to.  We do not test Black Belts until they are mature enough to demonstrate the qualities you would expect from one.";"http://www.mickdoyle.com/tag/womens-boxing/";"N/A";"MUAY THAI, Boxing";"$99/month This fee also gives you access to all Muay Thai and Boxing classes too ";"http://www.mickdoyle.com/schedule/";"Monday: 5:45 AM - 9:00 PM

That class was taught by the founder and chief instructor, Kimberly Woolery, at the time a 23 year old 2nd degree black belt. An open house was held on Sunday February 27, 1994 when the first original 10 students were signed up. The doors opened on the 28th with 5 beginner kids and 5 beginner adults, and only 2 instructors, Ms. Woolery and her instructor, Mr. Dale Miller.

By the 10 month anniversary of NAMA, the school had hit over 100 students and has not dropped below that number since. The average number of enrolled students at NAMA is about 120-150 students in the Taekwondo program, alone. The school now has over 30 instructors, varying from Senior Certified Instructors to our newest Junior Instructors, and we can’t forget the Trainee Instructors!! Each level of instructor has a testing qualification to complete to advance, starting with Junior, then T
rainee and finally the much sought after Certified, or “Black Stripe’ instructor!

When NAMA opened, we were affiliated with Martial Arts Research Systems, a kind of “parent organization” founded by Ms. Woolery and Mr. Miller’s instructor, Mr. Dale Lee Craig. The organization was new in 1991 and dissolved a few years later. Ms. Woolery did not join another organization, and became an independent school to keep dues at a minimum. Several other schools with similar backgrounds, have also become independent over the years, and most of us have come together to form a sort of alliance, for the purposes of tournaments in the area!

In 1998, Ms. Woolery joined the Omaha Police Department. While working midnights, she kept NAMA going strong during the evenings. That same year Ms. Woolery earned her 4th degree and eventually 5th degree in 2007. Also in 2007 , Mr. Jon Edwards, a 2nd Degree Taijutsu Black Belt, joined forces at NAMA with his MMA program. His program boasts a great base group of students and he has already been joined by more instructors to assist with the growing classes.

The Nebraska Academy of Martial Arts hosts many activities through the year: such as a regional TKD tournament every January, an adult summer camp every August, several kid’s lock-ins, four belt testings, and four belt rank ceremonies every year. We also have a Junior Black Belt Club (JBBC). The club offers the kids many fun activities, plus opportunities to become junior instructors, demo team members, and much more! Our newest group is our Competition Team, started in 2009. The Team is one of the most successful groups NAMA has ever had.

The following information will give you an idea of what the martial art is all about and what is offered here at Omaha’s Academy of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

What is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art that focuses on the ability of a smaller opponent to be able to defeat a much larger opponent through the use of leverage and superior techniques.  One is able to force an adversary to quit attacking through the use of various joint manipulations, joint locks, and also a variety of chokes.  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has grown in popularity over the years as it is also practiced as a sport where two people display their skills in an attempt to gain superior positions for points all the way to ending the match thru a variety of submission holds.

The use of Jiu-Jitsu can also be displayed in today’s sport of Mixed Martial Arts.  Traditionally, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is taught with students wearing a GI or Kimono.  This is what the uniform is called that students wear.  The art is also taught where students wear just shorts and t-shirt to give a different look to what may apply in an everyday setting.  This is called NO GI as a student is not wearing the GI to train in.  

There is a belt ranking system in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu which is as follows:  White, Blue, Purple, Brown, and Black.  Each belt has 4 degrees or stripes within it that one achieves on their way to the next belt level.  Students should expect to be very patient when it comes to promotion in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as many practitioners take 10 to 12 years to obtain a black belt.  

This is a very brief explanation of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to give one a basic understanding of what we do here.

See you on the mats!

YOUTH BRAZILIAN JIU-JITSU (BJJ)

The Youth Martial Arts program at Premier Combat Center is a comprehensive martial arts/self defense system for youth, ages 5-­14.  The Youth program includes classes in Brazilian Jiu-­Jitsu (BJJ), as well as classes in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).

We believe it is important for children to learn EFFECTIVE Martial Arts that actually work, and have been proven to be practical by our experienced instructors/competitors. Many places claim to teach MMA, Brazilian Jiu­-Jitsu, or whatever is trendy. We believe this is counter productive, as ineffective techniques lead to a false sense of security. If your child ever needs to defend him/her self, they have been set up to fail...

With classes in MMA and BJJ, kids in our program receive training that covers all aspects of self defense/combat sports, such as Boxing, Muay Thai Kickboxing, Karate, TaeKwondo, Wrestling, BJJ, Grappling/Submissions, etc. We also offer private lessons.

In today's world of immediate gratification, it's getting harder to teach children the value of working towards goals and the satisfaction that comes from a job well done.  Our children's program focuses on reinforcing traditional martial arts values such as trying one's best and never giving up.  Our students take pride in hard work and achieve their belts the old fashioned way.  They earn them!

 More than any other sport, the martial arts give your child the chance to explore their innate powers. They will marvel (as will you) as they increase in strength, flexibility, endurance, balance, and harmony. Yet this is only the beginning.

Physical skills are only part of the foundation in our training. Martial arts build young minds and bodies by building poise and self-assurance through knowledge.

Focal points of our program include development of fundamentals such as:

Confidence: Your child will find they can improve their physical stamina, increase their flexibility, strengthen and tone muscles, and build greater endurance. You will see them grow in confidence and discipline in the classroom, in their neighborhood, and with their friends. Martial arts are a work-out for the mind and the body.

Courage: Martial arts will help your child develop the courage to move outside of their comfort zone. As they mature, they learn to take responsibility for their actions, push through difficult tasks, and meet new challenges with an “I can” attitude. We give them tools to help with conflict resolution and ways to help navigate through life’s ups and downs.

Character: Studies have proven that a good martial arts program will have a positive impact on your child’s character. The life skills taught will arm your child with values and lessons to help them positively impact their community now and in adulthood. Their self-esteem will improve as they learn to set goals and then achieve them through hard work. They also learn to have respect for themselves and others.

“Martial Arts is one of the best things you can do for your child!.” But don't take our word for it...

About Taijutsu

Taijutsu is a Japanese word that translates into the English language as “skill with the body.” The fighting art of Taijutsu utilizes powerful striking skills, dynamic takedowns, effective ground fighting, and devastating finish holds. Taijutsu is a realistic, all-encompassing martial art system.
History

Taijutsu originated in Japan some six hundred years ago at the time of the feudal wars and being over run by a much superior force, the fore-fathers of Taijutsu retreated in to the mountains and fought a highly successful guerrilla war and in the process learned how to fight in a highly practical, but simple and effective way and finally won the war.

This was the birth of Taijutsu, and over the years unlike most other martial arts it keeps evolving to match the changes in the way people fight and what they fight with.";"http://www.taijutsuacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3593-taijutsu-academy.jpg";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay Thai, MMA";"N/A";"http://www.taijutsuacademy.com/schedule/";"Monday: 6:00 AM - 8:00 PM

S.I.M.S. Martial Arts Academy,

This academy has been a dream of mine since I stepped on the mats at 6 years old. 

The first art I learned was jiujitsu. My first instructor. Shihan Daryl Johnson, an inspirational figure without a doubt. Changed my life. One of the first lessons was to always be learning and always improving. The school motto was simply : ""Adapt and Survive"" Self-Defense at its finest. 

3 decades later and still on the mats, I've gained a tremendous amount of experience, knowledge, and technique to share with everyone. I've been a devoted student to the technical details of the arts for 3 decades now. I've earned multiple black belts in multiple styles. I can say that at this moment in my martial arts career I am completely obsessed with the art of jiujitsu. 

Training under the living legend Eddie Bravo, spreading 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu, and being the regions first black belt under Eddie has completely humbled and reshaped my jiujitsu journey. I'm incredibly indebted to Eddie for helping me realize my vision and always supporting my students in their endeavors. 

I began teaching private lessons in my mothers garage at 16 years old. These private lessons turned into a garage full of classes. At 25 I began our first academy and introduced 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu to the Midwest. Ever since we have taken the jiujitsu scene by storm creating some of the areas best grappling talents. 

Our unique and family oriented approach to training and teaching, has built our academy into a jiujitsu powerhouse. Our students come from all walks of life and our decades of instruction experience allows us to truly help anyone reach their goals.

About Our Family.

My mother originally helped me created and operate my academy.  My dad as the maintenance man and soon after my Family friends and original students, the Lopez Family.  

As our academy grew My wife and myself operating the academy became fortunate enough to bring in Anthony Lopez as our full time youth instructor. Anthony Lopez and his family had been my original starting students nearly 20 years ago. Anthony grew up within the dojo's beginnings starting at 3 years of age. His mother and father trained and between them all became ranked and respected members of the 10th Planet community. 

Anthony and Myself are the main instructors along with his fathers help and many other students with years of experience and family bonds being part of this academy. 

At this moment my daughter now after 7 years has been training under my Top student, Anthony, in our own kids classes continuing this family tradition now into a 3rd generation. 

We are committed to continuing our craft in the spirit it was built. Our dojo is rooted in deep jiujitsu traditions. Technique above everything and building character through the process.

Classes in a safe family environment for the entire family. We start working with kids, as young as 4 years old, and don't quit until they do (our oldest student is over 70.)

Welcome to the Center for Israeli Martial Arts in Las Vegas, teaching the Hisardut (meaning “Survival” in Hebrew) system of Dr. Dennis Hanover. We are the most authentic Israeli martial arts school in Southern Nevada, featuring classes in all major aspects of Israeli self defense and martial arts. We offer classes for adults, children, women, families, security teams and Law Enforcement Officials.

Long before the current MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) trend of combining martial arts styles started in the US, Dr. Dennis Hanover was fusing, Karate, Judo and Ju-Jitsu (sometimes spelled Jiu-Jitsu) together to create a unique self-defense/fighting style that could be taught to both civilians and Israeli military personnel – the system is now taught to elite units in the Israeli army, as well as the Mossad. This unique and effective system is now offered in Henderson, Las Vegas by Tomer Steinberg, 5th Degree Black Belt, and 2011 World Champion – the highest ranked instructor of the system in the U.S.

One of the things that distinguish Dennis-Hisardut from other “modern” self-defense systems is that it continues to teach the traditional message and values of the martial arts, such as: respect, integrity and honor, believing that it is these values which underpin and power the skills and techniques that the system teaches. This is why the style adds value to everybody’s day-to-day life as well as developing the survival mindset that is so crucial when dealing with a real-life assault or violent incident.

The Center for Israeli Martial Arts in Henderson is one of two US branches of Dennis Hisardut (Often referred to as Dennis Survival JuJitsu), teaching students of all ages and experience levels how to protect and stand up for themselves in any situation (as featured on the History Channel's ""Human Weapon"" Krav Maga episode).

We offer a warm welcome to all who come and train with us and practice our message of respect both on and off the mats. If you would like to come and take a free class to see how Hisardut training can affect your life please call us at 702-530-3755";"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQSOblhQEMZ_viLnVuxA3FR-BBv69r0e32gb4vYBcG4la-vkeA8";"http://www.israelimartialartslv.com/children.html";"All our teaching is age appropriate i.e. what we teach and how we teach a 6 year old is very different to how we teach a twelve year old. What all our children’s martial arts programs have in common though is the aim of developing your child’s character. We view ourselves not just as a gym or stereo-typical martial arts studio but as an educational facility that your child associates with fun. By creating an environment which is fun and enjoyable to be in and teaching physical skills and techniques that your child can believe in we can also communicate a message of respect: for themselves and for others.

The traditional martial arts approach of developing a relationship between instructor and student (often referred to as “scared space”) in a mentoring fashion means that our school can reinforce the positive message(s) that your child receives both at home and at school. We don’t just want to see your child improve on the mats and in their physical abilities but in all aspects and areas of their life. In a world of the “Gamebox” and “Playstation” we can help bring a level of normality and reality into a child’s life.

By getting young children and teens into a habit of engaging in physical activity at an early age they are likely to carry on and continue this practice into their adult years. Introducing this type of discipline into their lives now will pay dividends later. We believe fully in the benefits of martial arts training and practice what we preach: both our young daughters train in Hisardut and we see the positive influence it has on their lives.

More About Jiu-Jitsu

Jiu-Jitsu  is a martial art, combat sport, and a self-defense system that focuses on grappling .  It teaches that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique—most notably by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat or restrain the other person.

Jiu Jitsu training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self-defense. Sparring (a form of training, commonly referred to in Jiu Jitsu as “rolling”) and live drilling play a major role in training.";"http://www.ckjj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/logo-snake.png";"http://www.ckjj.com/kids-jiu-jitsu/";"Cobra Kai Jiu Jitsu is a family atmosphere for kids and adults of all ages.

Once famously known as Academy J-sect Jiu Jitsu, founder and MMA pioneer John Lewis, opened the first Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school in the Vegas Valley which became a popular training destination for mixed martial artist across the world. 
Lewis eventually teamed up with professional boxer and UNLV boxing coach Skipper Kelp to add the striking element to J-sect Jiu Jitsu. Academy J-sect quickly became one of the premier mixed martial arts training centers in the world. As the popularity of the UFC skyrocketed in the early to mid 2000's, J-sect opened its doors to the everyday person and was no longer just a place for fighters and jiu jitsu competitors. 

Academy J-sect's clientele became much more diversified and different classes were added to the curriculum to accommodate the new customers so that everyone could benefit from the knowledge and skills of Lewis and Kelp. Lewis, a successful entrepreneur and aspiring actor, moved to California to pursue other business opportunities and left sole ownership of the gym to Skipper Kelp. 

Kelp wanted the name of the gym to reflect what was happening inside, which was Boxing, Muay Thai, Judo, Jiu Jitsu, and MMA. So many fighting disciplines were represented under one roof that the only appropriate name could be the Fight Capital.";"https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/d526ead4/dms3rep/multi/mobile/logo-with-red-733x154.png";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"MMA, Boxing, Muay Thai";"N/A";"http://www.fightcapital.com/schedules";"Monday: 9:00 AM - 11:30 PM

Slowly he became recognized as a fighter of abilities, with ease of learning and hard to beat.

Two years later he was submitting most opponents in championships in a few minutes, even older fighters, well known ones, some even heavier than he. As the eighties came by, he was considered amongst the 5 best Jiu-Jitsu fighters around.

Now, 30 years later, during and after following a career as an airline pilot, Sergio never lost the affinity for the art, and continues to practice and teach Jiu-Jitsu. Currently living in Las Vegas, Sergio started his own business by opening the academy which carries his name, “Sérgio Penha Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy”.";"https://images.tapology.com/gyms/logos/3743/profile/3743-srgio-penha-brazilian-jiu-jitsu.jpg?1439325268";"http://sergiopenha.com/bjj-classes-las-vegas/";"YOUTH CLASSES

Children benefit from BJJ Classes in a number of ways.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art discipline that involves grappling and submission wrestling.
The fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu are to learn how to use your flexibility and leverage to defeat someone bigger and stronger than you.

There are many benefits for children in learning the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It helps develop self-confidence, learn discipline and familiarize children with the value of hard work. One of Sergio’s main philosophies is that hard work beats talent when talent does not work as hard. He and his other instructors believe that when you work hard and try your best at something you can do anything.

Studies show that children who participate in martial arts perform better in school, are physically healthier, have improved decision-making, and are less likely to be influenced by peer pressure. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu teaches respect for others and respect of self.

With bullying an issue in children’s lives, it is necessary to give them the tools to prevent bullying all together. The first line of defense against bullying is confidence. BJJ classes help children gain self-esteem and confidence and teaches them how to defend themselves against such intrusions.";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://sergiopenha.com/bjj-classes-las-vegas/";"N/A";"Sergio Luiz da Penha";"N/A";"info@sergiopenha.com";"https://www.facebook.com/sergiopenhabrazilianjiujitsu/";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"No";

What is kung fu?  Literally translated from Chinese (功夫, gong fu), kung fu means hard work to become an accomplished person. Kung fu requires consistent time and conscientious effort. Many benefits can arise from the diligence such as focus, self control, self-confidence, connection of mind and body, as well as physically fit bodies which are trained for self-defense.

Some of the training includes punches, strikes, kicks, rolls, leg sweeps, and flips.  The exercises and basic kung fu movements condition the children to be swift, agile, strong, and flexible.  As they are promoted and progress to higher levels, they will also take on weapons training using the wooden staff, broadsword or straight sword, spear, 9-section chain whip, and other various weapons.The practice is rigorous and challenging, but the kids love it.  Find out for yourself.  Bring your child in for a free trial class. You are welcome to contact us if you have further questions or simply show up to either class 1 or class 2 (see below).

EACH CLASS WILL BEGIN WITH WARM-UPS WHICH INCLUDE A VARIETY OF STANCE, FOOTWORK, PUNCHES, KICKS, KNEES, AND ELBOWS EXERCISES, AS WELL AS COUNTER TECHNIQUES. DURING THE CORE CONDITIONING AND CIRRICULUM PORTION OF THE CLASS, STUDENTS WILL BE PAIRED WITH A PARTNER, AND AT TIMES WITH A PUNCHING BAG. DRILLS CONSIST OF A COMBINATION OF THE BASIC TECHNIQUES IN A FLOW OR SIMULATED ENCOUNTER. STUDENTS GRADUATING FROM THE BEGInNER CLASS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MASTERY OF THE BASIC TECHNIQUES, AS WELL AS STAMINA AND CONDITIONING, AS DETERMIONED BY THE INSTRUCTOR. THIS WILL HELP stUDENTs BECOME BETTER EQUIPPED FOR the MMA PROGRAM.

BEGINNER GRAPPLING class:
THE FOCAL POINT OF THE BEGINNER CLASS IS ENTIRELY ON TECHNIQUES. THE CLASS CONCENTRATES ON LEARNING AND APPLYING THE FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES OF BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU AND WRESTLING WITH A GI. STUDENTS LEARN AND PRACTICE SUBMISSIONS, ESCAPES, POSITIONING, AND DEFENSE. THE COURSE ALSO COVERS A VARIETY OF GRIP TECHNIQUES. WARM-UPS CONSIST OF CALESTHEnICS, PLyOMETRICS, AND CONDITIONING DRILLS. STUDENTS ARE PAIRED WITH EACH OTHER. THIS FUNDAMENTALS CLASS IS DIRECTED NOT ONLY FOR BEGInNERS BUT ALSO FOR THE MORE ADVANCED STUDENTS TO SHARPEN BASIC TECHNIQUES. WHEN A STUDENT JOINS THE BEGInNER PROGRAM, HE/SHE IS observed and evaluated BY THE INSTRUCTORS AND IS INFORMED WHEN READY TO ADVANCE TO INTERMEDIATE GRAPPLING.

NO GI (SUBMISSION GRAPPLING) CLASS:
THIS CLASS IS BASED ON TECHNIQUES OF TRADITIONAL GI BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU, AND ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF A UNIFORM TO HOLD ON TO. THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES REMAIN THE SAME. IN SUBMISSION GRAPPLING, STUDENTS LEARN AN ENTIRELY NEW SET OF GRIPS. THE WRISTS, BACK OF THE NECK, ANKLE, KNEE AND ELBOW GRIPS ARE ALL DIFFERENT THEN TRADITIONAL GI. STUDENTS LEARN TAKEDOWNS, POSITIONS, TRANSITIONS, ESCAPES, AND REVERSALS. METHODS ON HOW TO APPLY AND DEFEND AGAINST JOINT LOckS, CHOKES AND OTHER SUBMISSIONS HOLDS ARE ALSO COVERED.

THIS GIVES STUDENTS A NEW DIMENSION TO THEIR EXISTING SKILL SET. THE CLASS MAY BE TRAINED SOLELY OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH TRADITIONAL BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU CLASSES. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND BOTH ASPECTS, CONSIDERING MOST TOURNAMENTS OFFER BOTH GI AND NO GI DIVISIONS. NO GI TRAINING MAKES FOR A FASTER AND MORE DYNAMIC STYLE OF FIGHTING. THE NO GI PROGRAM IS AN IDEAL FIT FOR EVERYONE LOOKING TO BECOME A MORE COMPLETE practitioner or FIGHTER, AND EVEN THOSE INTERESTED IN A GREAT FITNESS PROGRAM.

"Manchester Gracie Jiu Jitsu";"http://manchesterkarate.com/";" +1 603-625-5835";"371 South Willow Street - 2nd floor";"Manchester";"NH";3103;"5/5 Stars";"United States";"Mr. White began training in the martial arts at the age of eleven and by his Senior year of High School he had earned his Black Belt. Following High School, Mr. White served in the United States Naval Reserve for six years. Upon his return to civilian life he opened the Manchester Karate Studio in October of 1984, and has since served as its director and chief instructor. Mr. White is currently an 8th Degree Black Belt in the Parker system of Kenpo Karate.

Mr. White received his early training in the Ed Parker system of Kenpo Karate from Mr. Lee Wedlake, Jr., one of Mr. Parker‘s first generation Black Belt students. After completing the physical requirements of the Kenpo system with Mr. Wedlake, he was referred to Mr. Richard “Huk” Planas – the Executive Director of Ed Parker‘s martial arts organization, the International Kenpo Karate Association (IKKA). With Mr. Planas‘ and Mr. wedlake instruction and guidance, Mr. White developed a keen understanding of the master key moves used by Mr. Parker. Mr. White ran a series of Kenpo techniques that completed one of the Kenpo ―base move categories. Impressed with his understanding and ability to apply the Kenpo system, Mr. Parker personally selected Mr. White to be the Technical Director for the New England region of the IKKA in 1987. At this time, Mr. White was serving as the IKKA State Representative for New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont.

In 1989, Mr. White became the first Kenpo instructor in New England to have students complete the requirements for Black Belt in the Parker system of Kenpo. These five individuals tested before the New England IKKA Board of Examiners (headed by Mr. Parker) and all five were promoted to 1st Degree Black Belt. Prior to these promotions, and still true for many regions of New England today, Black Belt rankings were politically awarded to individuals who were either in the process of learning the Parker system of Kenpo or who were training in various Chinese based martial arts.

Following the passing of Mr. Parker in December of 1990, Mr. White founded the New England Chinese Karate Federation (NECKF) to preserve the original system of Kenpo Karate as developed by Mr. Parker. Today the NECKF stretches from Connecticut to upstate Maine with over 1,000 students. Later the NECKF merged with the Progressive Kenpo Systems (PKS) which is led by Mr. Lee Wedlake.

In addition to his martial arts career, Mr. White has completed a Lock Flow Drill and a Handcuffing and Weapons Retention program for local and state police officers in New Hampshire. In September of 1998, Sgt. Joseph Marceau, the director of the Police Standards and Training Council, invited him to present his program to the New Hampshire police state trainers in Concord, NH. Mr. White‘s training methods are now in use in several N.H. police barracks.

All Children's classes are taught by Master Instructor Terry Dow, who has 15+ years of teaching experience with children.

We instill positive training approaches that allow children to:

    Gain greater CONFIDENCE and SELF ESTEEM
    Improve STUDY HABITS and CONCENTRATION
    Gain COORDINATION and FOCUS

Greater DISCIPLINE and, to some degree, self-defense (depending on the age of the child).

When looking for a program for children, one of the most important things to look for is not WHICH art to enroll your child in, but which INSTRUCTOR is best for your child! 

It is important that the instructor understands what is appropriate to do and not to do with the things they learn in class. All this is developed while having a great time, with many activities designed to allow the children to learn creatively, and have fun at the same time. 

Our program is broken into age groups:

Tiny Tots:  Ages 3-5   


The goal of this class is to focus on listening skills along with balance, coordination, and prepare the children to get ready to advance to the Kids Martial Arts program.

Kids Martial Arts:  Ages 5.5 - 10    


Master Terry Dow is the head instructor for this program. In this class, the children will be learning Kenpo Karate. 

Teen Martial Arts:  Ages 10.5 to 15   


Master Terry Dow is also the head instructor for this program.   In addition to Kenpo Karate, Master Dow will be teaching the children, self defense techniques, and sparring drills.   If the children wish to compete, there are several local competitions that The Training Station is involved in.

In our martial arts for children program we strive to instill self-discipline, confidence, focus, self-defense abilities and total fitness in our students. Our programs have been designed to help every student stay motivated and feel good about themselves and their progress.

The emphasis of our children’s program is on establishing a foundation of courtesy, self-respect and self-discipline in your child from the moment they begin their martial arts training. This foundation begins to take shape as your child learns to do something as simple as bowing to their instructors and their fellow students as a sign of courtesy and respect.

The program will build confidence and character by providing children with a sense of control over their body and their actions. The many movements of martial arts also help children to develop their coordination, strength, endurance and flexibility, which is very important during their growing years.

Your child will have many opportunities to test the limits of their mental and physical capabilities as they test for the higher levels of the martial arts belt ranks. The awarding of these belts give children a sense of pride and achievement. Training for these tests, and passing them, enhances your child’s ability to focus, concentrate, set goals, plan for and triumph over the many learning hurdles they will encounter as they grow older.

Martial arts instruction may also involve free style sparring (sport karate). This helps to develop a child’s sense of fair play and good sportsmanship in a controlled competitive environment. 

The foundation of martial arts is the ability to protect and defend oneself. We are very careful to teach children that the martial arts are not used outside the classes in any manner other than true self defense. The result of their training is a confident and self-disciplined child who does not need to bully or show off to other children.

Finally, martial arts are good clean fun for kids and a great way to burn off their extra energy. We believe strongly in the value of our programs for all ages, but especially for the young, who can benefit from the martial arts for the rest of their lives.

When the people of Tyngsborough come to Gate City MMA to learn martial arts, they don’t just receive training, but a staff that is dedicated to helping them improve themselves.
Dedicated to enhancing our students

Learning a martial art can be the memorizing of moves, but at Gate City MMA we focus on teaching our students much more. Martial arts is, in some respects, a way of life. We do not mean that certain individuals earn a living from being in matches or teaching. Martial arts is a way of life because it practices mindfulness. When you practice a strike, a throw, or an exercise, the goal is to understand your body and be one with the movement. Eventually the goal is to, in time, be completely present in the moment and learn how to bring out that amount of centeredness when you need it. All the stresses in your life become much more manageable when you know how to find your center and understand that you have the mental tools you need to overcome the problem.
Martial arts instruction in Tyngsborough

Our instructors are expertly trained martial artists and experienced teachers. No matter what level a person has achieved, there is always more knowledge to gain and ways to refine one’s techniques. That is why our instructors continue to educate themselves in their martial art traditions. They understand that being able to impart knowledge is not a simple process. It requires keen observations about individuals and how they receive information, so you can make slight changes quickly to facilitate learning.

We are very proud of the courses we offer the people of Tyngsborough and we welcome you to try one to see why Gate City MMA is the right choice for martial arts practitioners.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c13.12.154.154/1779241_1457249161158539_1995226661_n.jpg?oh=6a4f108b027c46b11b66bc9bc3370f04&oe=5B38EDD1";"https://gatecitymma.com/martial-arts-classes/child-classes/";"Martial arts classes for kids in Nashua

Children need lots of activity to use all the energy they have and grow up healthy and strong. But learning a martial art is much more than that. It also starts a child on a lifelong path of enjoying physical activity in a positive atmosphere.

A lack of physical activity is a problem that adults and children face not only in Nashua but throughout the country, and it is one of the main causes of obesity and deteriorating health in our society. To counteract the issue of poor health, we need to get people motivated and enjoying being active. This is one of the primary focuses Gate City MMA has when engaging with our students, especially the younger ones. We make every effort to ensure our classes as engaging as possible for the young people of Nashua, so that they will pick up the skills and attitude that will make their lives easier and more rewarding.

Gate City MMA organizes its martial arts classes for children around the idea that different children learn in different ways. We use a variety of different teaching techniques to help our students remember what we teach them, because the faster they learn the faster they can move forward.

The Kids Program at Triumph BJJ was developed by Black Belt John Fain, MSW. Professor Fain is a former Adjunct Psychology and Sociology Professor and Child and Family Therapist.

Students at Triumph BJJ not only learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) but also develop control, coordination, dexterity, stamina, strength, flexibility, self-awareness, respect and the ability to negotiate confrontations. These attributes translate extremely well to all aspects of life.

Our kids do not listen just because they are told to. Once they become a part of the program the natural hierarchy becomes apparent.

This method further results in a fun and nurturing environment for everyone involved.

Headed up by Kyle Briere, our coaching staff delivers individually focused performance training in a group setting. We begin with in-depth health and exercise evaluations, functional training, strength training, nutrition coaching, injury rehabilitation and more, producing dramatic results for each individual client. We are uniquely qualified to improve, refine, and build a healthier you.

Motivated to create his own approach to performance training, Kyle signed his first lease and began building the original gym while on a winter break from his graduate studies. Working full time towards his Masters in Exercise Science, Kyle found a way to balance family, school, business, and his athletics. “The experience of starting a business while in school taught me a lot; mainly about the right mindset, belief, and the necessity of time management.”

With the help of friends and family the walls were painted, platforms built, equipment assembled, and flooring installed. Since first opening its doors, the business has evolved with a new name, grown in size, and become an established and well-respected training facility.

“Greatness follows belief and repetition.”

VeritasPT’s science-based training methods focus on building efficient stability and mobility patterns first, before strength training. This methodology reduces the likelihood of injuries from inefficient movement patterns and drives clients to focus on proper form first.

Under Kyle’s guidance, VPT’s goal is simple: create a training process and atmosphere that achieves results, supports growth, and encourages everyone. Kyle and his staff will help chase down your dream goals and motivate you on your quest for a healthier lifestyle.

Veritas Performance Training values its place in the local community, building and growing relationships with local organizations. Girls, Inc., Nelson’s, Nashua Soup Kitchen, Nashua High South, Merrimack High, Tyngsborough Middle School, Rapid Machining, Highland Tool, Enterprise Bank, CBHstudio, Fenix Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Frame 36 Photography, Vear Commercial Properties, Quarry View Farm, The Atkins Group are just a few.

At Madama Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy we have specialized kids programs in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, no-gi grappling, and kickboxing five days per week. Our programs aren't play-time though we do use a game-centered teaching program to better have our kids in a mindset to learn.

Our kids learn real Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and real kickboxing techniques. While these techniques are simplified, they are not watered down.

Our goals are not only to increase their discipline, fitness levels, and ability to defend themselves but also to be ready to work seamlessly into our adult classes when they become old enough. Our classes are for children between the ages of 6 (depending on their maturity) and 14-years-old.

Our instructors have years of experience teaching martial arts to children. Our head instructors (or coaches) are all parents and many of our assistant coaches have either graduated from the kids classes into the adult classes or are senior students with a passion for teaching and helping our kids.

This simple mission has guided the original Edge School of Wrestling for the last 30 years as America’s first amateur wrestling club of its kind.  Edge founder, Ernie Monaco, devised a progressive system of wrestling instruction and training that sought to develop the entire athlete, fully aware of both the mental and physical dimensions of the sport.  What makes the “Edge System” so unique is that students were able to fully develop at one club for their entire wrestling career, many starting in elementary school and staying with the club beyond their wrestling years to either coach or bring their own children.  One of those life-long students was Hoboken Edge founder, Dave Esposito. Dave started at the Edge when he was eight years old to become one of the club’s most decorated wrestlers and proponents of the Edge System, both as a wrestler and coach for the Edge.

At Edge Hoboken, Dave and his team have successfully applied those same principles of success to not only wrestling, but other martial arts as well.  At Edge Hoboken, students can be exposed to the Edge System in wrestling, kickboxing (muy-thai), jui jitsu/grappling, and mixed-martial arts (mma).  Students will be trained by highly decorated instructors within the Edge System in a top-level training facility steps away from New York City in the vibrant, mile-square city of Hoboken.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/28167055_1875478005798097_8996591968076858151_n.jpg?oh=89f858b6e52319c038061dc2a2fff049&oe=5B46D241";"http://edgehoboken.com/kids-programs/wrestling-for-kids/";"Wrestling For Kids

Through our ‘level’ based wrestling progression we specialize in bringing the full potential out in your student athlete.

Top Five Reasons to get your children started
 We are different than the Karate, Tae Kwon Do, kung fu and other martial arts in Hoboken and Jersey City.

How? Wrestling is very different from these martial arts. It is the oldest sport in history and has been used to build confidence in the lives of millions of youths across the world. It is also the only of these sports to be contested at the NCAA level where full support and scholarships are offered. We are professionals, most of our instructors are full time teachers, have competed at the youth, high school, and national levels. Our head coach even has his Master’s Degree in Education from Columbia University. We love what we do and it shows.

 We are serious about developing your child for life.

“Wrestling is a microcosm of life” - Mark Churella. To us wrestling is the greatest tool for character development. Through our curriculum and coaching style, we are able to help cultivate healthy confidence, focus, assertiveness, a goal oriented mindset, and social skills.

Our program has recent graduates that opened doors to higher education through wrestling and are wrestling at North Carolina, Columbia, Princeton, Johnson and Whales, Stevens Institute. We have helped over 200 kids reach their goal of gaining college access through wrestling.

 Our Program is extremely safe.

Our instructors have over 10,000 hours of mat time combined, and each one has an intense emphasis on safety, respect, and control. We have a fully padded training area, including wall and floor mats.

 Kids learn control while developing an athletic base.

Wrestling involves more than just fitness, while some martial arts focus on acrobatics and kicks. Wrestling requires kids to focus on controlling themselves first, once this is mastered their focus then shifts to controlling their environment. We build balance, motor control, strength, mental toughness, and endurance all through movement. As coordination and confidence improve each child progresses to the next level only when they are ready.

 We work hard to instill dreams and goals.

Our program is designed to inspire and to excel. We take your child through the developmental stages of mastery. From reinforcing good habits with encouragement and a playful understanding to an identity based level two. Here students are encouraged to ask questions and set goals. Finally we help your athlete reach ultra high levels of success by giving world class technical feedback. This 6-7 year process of development has proved to find success for hundreds of kids. This process begins by us welcoming you into our program. Please register for a trial class.";"N/A";"N/A";"MMA";"N/A";"http://edgehoboken.com/schedule/";"Monday: 4:00 PM - 10:00 PM

Training Jiu Jitsu will give you the confidence to walk talk with your head held high both in the boardroom, and in your relationships. It isn’t just about fighting, it’s about having self-esteem because you now you are working towards your goals and CRUSHNG them every single day.
3. Develop laser focus.

Both kids and adults will feel sharper and more focused. Studies have shown exercise improves cognitive function and kids who practice Martial Arts even GET BETTER GRADES.

If you want your child (or yourself) to do better in school, be able to focus and complete a task when asked, and have a more positive mental attitude overall, then Jiu Jitsu is the place for you.
4. Make Friends and Be Part Of The Team.

BJJ is one of the best ways to make new friends and socialize. You (or your child) will meet dozens of likeminded people and make friends from the very first day you step into Hoboken Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Egos are left at the door. We have a very warm and welcoming environment where people come and bring their children to become the best versions of themselves that they can be.

If your child has trouble socializing, our Martial Arts classes will let him or her make friends in a welcoming environment all while developing more self-esteem and social skills.
5. Have FUN!

That’s right. What good is going to the gym if you don’t HAVE FUN?! We pride ourselves on working hard and meeting our goals WHILE we have fun, joke, and laugh with our friends. If running on a treadmill alone for an hour doesn’t sound like a good time to you, then come try us out and see how much fun Jiu Jitsu really is. Your children will also love it and will talk your ear off about what they learned in classes and how many new friends they made.

Each session of the program will consist of a 45 minute class. The children will learn some of the basic blocks, kicks and punches of TKD.
There will be no physical contact between students and many practice drills will be conducted on kicking pads and shields. Students will be taught lessons in the proper time and situations for use of their new-found skills.

The overarching goal of the our Little Dragons Program is to build our student's self esteem, which we do by acknowledging, recognizing and rewarding not just our student's accomplishments and successes, but their efforts as well.

Our emphasis goes far beyond just learning physical moves and martial arts techniques. We use martial arts as a mechanism to develop positive character and life-improvement skills in our students.  Part of our goal is to bring out the personal-development aspects of each child, such as increasing self confidence, improving focus and concentration, developing self discipline, and coordination and balance.

• Focus and Concentration

• Self-Discipline

• Physical Fitness

• Positive Attitude

• Coordination and Balance

• Respect

Junior's Program

Our Junior's program is designed to promote the ideals of focus, respect, discipline, loyalty, and self-confidence, the most important aspects of a child's training. They must learn and understand the tenets of Taekwondo - ""Taekwondo aims to achieve courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self control and indomitable spirit"" - and practice them inside and outside the dojang.

We aim to channel the interest children have in the martial arts into activities that enforce these ideals and are designed to increase physical conditioning and peer interaction, and sharpen coordination and motor skills. Most importantly, we believe that students will learn the many valuable lessons of the martial arts while actually having fun.

We teach children all levels of Taekwondo techniques, from traditional basics and forms to Olympic-style sparring and self-defense. Students are expected to give 100% in each class. Promotion tests are offered approximately every three months. Prior to testing, students are required to show that they are in good academic standing by presenting their report card. Students are also expected to give 100% in school and at home as well. Academic updates will be given to Master Claudio and the JC Taekwondo Academy Staff on a regular basis and parents will be asked to share how the behavior of each student is at home.

OUR MISSION

Our mission is to bring out the very best in all our students. We empower people of all ages to achieve their full potential by emphasizing self-defense, health, fitness and life skills in a friendly, safe and positive environment.  Our students discover capabilities within themselves they never thought possible and become more confident, successful contributing members of the community.

WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT AT SATORI ACADEMY

 

The curriculum at Satori Academy is a unique blend of martial arts styles and places strong emphasis on valuable life skills such as perseverance, focus and self-discipline. The result: As students learn highly effective self-defense techniques, they experience new levels of confidence and empowerment.

*  For children, this means better grades in school and better behavior at home.

*  Teens gain a level of confidence that gives them a huge advantage in dealing with peer pressure and the complexities in their lives.

*  Adults increase success in business and have more fulfilling personal relationships.

Imagine having the clarity to know exactly what you want to accomplish and the mental strength to excel at whatever you set your mind to.

This victorious ascent started with Sensei Ricardo Carvalho’s initiative when he decided to start his own academy because of the large number of students he had.

​Previously, in 1989, his brother — Sensei Edson Carvalho — had left to fight in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he quickly attained and established great fame. So with intentions to honor his brother Sensei Ricardo Carvalho named the academy after him. 


At that time, Jiu-Jitsu was being promoted in the state of Bahia in Brazil, although the largest concentration of fighters was in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and the city of Manaus in the state of Amazonas.

Sensei Edson Carvalho is a native of Bahia and because he already had a large following and respected name in Rio de Janeiro, he was able to command a greater interest and his fellow citizens' great admiration thus he was the catalyst for the growth of Jiu-Jitsu in Bahia.



Competitions were taking place everywhere in Bahia and they were great incentives for fighters who wanted better performances and greater competitiveness; all with a healthy and positive balance. 

In that context, Senseis Edson and Ricardo Carvalho created “(JJFB) Federacao Baina De Jiu-Jitsu” in 1996. 

Their objective was to manage the growth of the sport in Bahia different from other states. After all, they had an extensive historical and strong influence from the discipline of Judo in their backgrounds. 

The difference is in the slogan of JJFB: "" Jiu-Jitsu Against Drugs"". A philosophy of discipline and respect among the participants, athletes and leaders is followed not only by JJFB but for all that join Team Carvalho anywhere in the world

In this regard, Team Carvalho serves as an incentive to change bad habits and develop abilities that will help his or her overall growth. The abilities that your son or daughter will acquire with Team Carvalho, will help them develop as human beings and become confident, attentive, disciplined, responsible, respectful of others, better adjusted socially, with good motor and cognitive coordination, more agile, with good reflexes, self-esteem, self-knowledge, and self-control in any situation that life brings them. 

The importance of the Judo in your child’s development: 
Judo is practiced by both sexes and it has contributed greatly with parents and teachers in helping children's development. In some countries such as France and Japan, Judo is such an important sport that it is part of the school curriculum. The child that practices Judo develops muscles gently. Many orthopedic physicians recommend Judo during childhood, because they believe that it’s a good for normal development in this stage of life without compromising growth and physical structures. The practice of a sport is essential to motivate a child all around. It helps children occupy their minds with healthy thoughts and attitudes and it develops the body in a healthy way. 

WHY TEAM CARVALHO?

Team Carvalho has worldwide recognition in the martial arts field; it employs highly qualified professionals to teach your child everything he or she needs to develop good psych-motor skills through Recreational Judo.  We believe that any and all efforts dedicated to shaping a child's life is valid as long as it’d done with competence, responsibility, knowledge and appropriate techniques. We work with children 4 years old and older. Our work is based on Judo techniques, its philosophy is of Japanese origin and it’s founded on forming characters through sport. 
What happens during class?

The first thing the children learn is to pay attention, obey, respect, order, and good behavior. We delay teaching fighting because very young children cannot concentrate and only want to play. But soon they want to copy the older kids and in this way they adapt easily to the rest of the group.  As previously mentioned we use Recreational Judo; kids have fun and learn at the same time.


    Motor Coordination: activities that work every muscle in the body and also benefit the cardiovascular system.
    Cognitive Development: agility exercises, reflexes and reasoning.
    Emotional Development: teachings of discipline, respect, organization, responsibility, obedience and execution of tasks (school, family and social).
    Social Development: activities for pairs or groups; it provides interaction and socialization with other children.


The classes last 1 hour; at first there are greetings between the Sensei (teacher) and the Disciples (students), followed by stretching and gym workouts. All body parts are warmed and exercised in a subtle way, best suited for children’s muscles and body structures.

He then began to study under Sensei Michael in the art of Freestyle Karate. Sensei Michael was a NYC Guardian Angel who taught Soke Ray to blend multiple karate systems that were being utilized at the Guardian Angels training facility.

At the age of fifteen, Soke Ray began boxing at the PAL center on 183rd Street and Webster Avenue in the Bronx under Coach Rick. Soke Ray relocated to Bayonne, NJ and continued his training in Isshinryu Karate under Shihan Jerry Tardi and Shihan George Strydio.

“Every discipline of martial art has something to offer and only a misguided practitioner would think different”. – Soke Ray

Soke’s philosophy of martial arts was that every art represented a quarter in a dollar, and in order to be capable of defending yourself from any compromising position you need to incorporate these arts.

Senshi Tori Mixed Martial Arts was the vision of Soke Ray Rivera to blend each discipline in which he trained. Senshi Tori MMA is a blending of boxing, kick boxing, Japanese jujitsu, judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and submission grappling.

Benefits of ABQKB-MMA's Youth Martial Arts Program

Self-Confidence
For many children, self confidence doesn't come naturally. Confidence is developed over a period of time. As a child accomplishes new goals, his or her confidence level increases. Children become more self-confident in Martial Arts because they progress at their own pace and are not compared to others.

Better Grades
Being a Martial Artist also means being a better student. Every child learns to follow directions, pay attention in class and participate in class activities. These skills help them to become better students.

Coordination
Martial Arts challenges the entire body, developing coordination, balance, agility and poise. These traits are often neglected and not fully developed in team sports.

Discipline
Martial Arts will help your child to discover that through self-discipline and perseverance he or she can accomplish almost anything.

Self-Defense
Martial Arts teaches children to think instead of panic in potentially serious situations as well as how to react to threats from other kids. Your child will also be taught not to be a bully. For life threatening situations only, your child will learn practical self-defense.

There is confusion today when speaking in the history of Jiu-Jitsu. Books, magazines and practitioners always say (wrongly) that Jiu-Jitsu was born in India around 2000 years ago. This concept is wrong and distorted. There is confusion today when speaking in the history of Jiujitsu. Books, magazines and practitioners always say (wrongly) that Jiujitsu was born in India around 2000 years ago. This concept is wrong and distorted.

Problems in translation

                The confusion begins at its own name, the correct spelling for the word (柔 術) in Japanese Jujutsu would be (for English-speaking language) which means ""gentle art"" or ""gentle art"". The pronunciation in Portuguese is close to díuu-di-tsu (pronunciation for us who speak Portuguese is alienígna and unnatural).

The term Ju in Kanji means smooth. Kanji ""jitsu"" means true, so it would be something like ""true light,"" what is wrong, right is ""Jutsu"" which means technique. Ignoring the correct spelling in Portuguese became known in Brazil as Jiujitsu since it pronucie ""Djiuu-djii-tsu"".

Confusion Historical

                The confusion which arose in saying that India would be the mother of all martial arts of the East comes from the fact Bodhidharma, Indian, have entered the Shaolin temple in China, Vajra exercises Mushti (old-style fighting Indian nobility ) as official techniques to the monks endure the long hours of meditation.

                Bodhidharma found that the monks constantly passed out and did not have a good physical preparation needed to stay for hours motionless form of wire, just meditating. Thus introduced exercise required all monks, influencing the temples so that henceforth hone the physical part. It is noteworthy that some monks have practiced some styles of Kung Fu, but it was lonely and unrelated to the discipline of the temples. The Vajra Mushti is an ancient art, with reports dating from the 5th century BC, but nothing reminds the Japanese or Chinese arts. This confusion happened with the Kung Fu as well, since it was associated as a specialization of these exercises. This confusion already dissipated because it has been proven that long before existed styles of Kung Fu, from the time doImperador Yellow (around 2000 BC).

Because of this confusion sofismável, he credited the Kung Fu would have been from India, have been exported to Japan by merchants and Buddhist monks. The unique style of Kung Fu that could remember Jiujitsu would Shuai Jiao, a kind of Chinese Wrestling known since the time of the Yellow Emperor. There are reports of Chinese traders demonstrating Shuai Jiao around 1600 in Japan, so it may even be that some Jiujitsu style has been influenced, but this time the samurai long time already had a refined jiujitsu.

 

Jiu-Jitsu Origins

 

From the earliest times man knew fighting styles based on grappling as accounts in the Bible, Greek philosophers, Egypt of the pharaohs or in caves of France in the time of mammoths and dandelion sabers tigers around 10,000 years before Christ. Hercules was known as an accomplished wrestler in ancient Greek mythology.

 

Alexander the Great, during the campaign in India sponsored several challenges wrestling between his soldiers and officers against the world champions, we might even say that Indian styles would come from the Greek Pankration, but we would be assuming without concrete evidence.

 

Anyway the ancient world provided contact between different cultures through wars and challenges and it would be natural that such different styles were exported, known and improved by other people. If we look at history, all the old people had some wrestling style, from the Greeks, through the Babylonians to the Persians japonses.

 

There is nothing to discredit the genuine origin of the Japanese Jiujitsu, ancient styles were already mentioned in ancient chronicles books as Nihon Shoki, Kokki or Kojiki.

In the book of chronicles Nihon Shoki, there are reports of a competition called Chikara-Kurabe, it was a competition where fighters confrotavam rule that resemble both the Sumo as Jiujitsu. This competition was held on the 7th year of Emperor Suinin (29AC-70AD), around the year 22 BC.

 

The Japanese feudal system was based on the samurai caste divided into clans. A clan was formed by several families of both samurai and farmers, both were vassals of a daimyo who in turn was subjected to a Shogun who was who actually ruled Japan. The emperor for many centuries was just a display piece such which today the queen of England means to Britain.

 

A clan had several samurai families, these families were noble and only they could practice the arts of war as bojutsu (stick with art), kenjutsu (art with the sword), jujutsu (unarmed technique), among others.

 

Each clan had its own style and Jiujitsu during the clashes and the technical challenges were known by opponents. It was treason if a samurai teach the techniques of a clan to a member of another clan, if that happened he should practice Harakiri (suicide).

Around the year 1600 AD, there were about 2,000 schools (RYU) Jiujitsu in Japan, which corresponds to more than one per clan. The most famous were:

 

Araki-ryu

Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu

Hontai Yoshin-ryu

Kashima Shin-ryū

Sekiguchi Shinshin-ryu

Sosuishitsu-ryu

Takenouchi-ryu

Tatsumi-ryu

Tenjin Shinyo-ryu

Yagyu Ryu Shingan

Yoshin Ryu

 

After the end of the feudal period with the advent of the Meiji era (Restoration), the samurai were marginalized and had to survive by opening schools for lay people, joining the recent imperial army or taking technical positions in foreign companies (as they were well educated and had knowledge in painting, writing, poetry and other Japanese arts, something that ordinary citizens do not possuím for being illiterate mostly).

 

During this time many schools merged, the most celebrated of all as the Kodokan, joined various masters in different styles Jiujitsu and unified various techniques from styles as diverse as Daito-ryu (giving rise to Aikido) by Shiro Saigo , through the Fusen-Ryu (where a fighter appeared at the Kodokan and rowed all students of Jigoro Kano with soil techniques, which he left most current ne-waza techniques) to Kito-ryuque Kano himself studied (specialized in technical projections or nage-waza). Daito-ryu also gave rise to the Korean style of Hapkido, its founder, Choi Yong Sul, merged with oTaekwondo.

Note below that image Kodokan the meeting of various masters in different styles Jiujitsu who joined Kodokan:

..Masamizu Inazu of Miura Ryu

... Jushin Sekiguchi of Sekiguchi Ryu

... Shikataro Takano of Takeuchi Ryu

... Hidekazu Nagaoka the Kodokan

... Sakujiro Yokoyama of Kodokan

... Hajime Isogai the Kodokan

... Yoshiaki Yamashita of the Kodokan

 

We can say that the Kodokan became the best school jiujitsu the early 20th century, Jigoro Kano not only studied other styles as invited several teachers from other schools, in addition to that sent students to study other styles in other regions and even other countries. But by emphasizing competition and struggle mainly with rules that favored the fight standing (with projections of blows) plus the withdrawal of several blows considered dangerous, the Jiujitsu was wasting away and disappeared from the world.

 

Jigoro Kano came to study and adapt techniques of Western Wrestling (which influenced the rules of the Kodokan in the years to hold back the opponent to the ground during a given time), as well as boxing and other oriental martial arts training at the Kodokan.

 

Thanks to Gracie family who kept the samurai spirit and favored ground fighting taught by Mitsuyo Maeda, considered extinct and unknown blows of modern Judo practitioners were rescued. Now with the success of Jiujitsu in Vale-all tournaments around the world, Judo blows that were lost are rescued from old books and videos around the world.

 

Special mention to the video ""The Essence of Judo"" of Kyuzo Mifuneque shows a close Judo their origins and closely resembles the Brazilian Jiujitsu displayed mainly in soil techniques.

Mataemon Tanabe, Fusen Ryu master in the image below:

 

All famous techniques of Brazilian Jiujitsu were already known to the Kodokan and came from a specific style of the old Jiujitsu as Armlock (ude hishigi Juji gatame), triangle (sankaku juji jime), kimura Key (Gyaku Ude Garami), American (Ude Garami) Ezekiel (Sode Guruma Jime), Wood-lion (rear naked choke), Clock (Koshi Jime), Bahia (Morote gari), scapula (Ashi Garami), Guillotine (Tate hishigi), Guillotine on guard (Giaku hishigi), Scissors ( Kani Garami), foot switch (Ashi Dori Garami) and even called gogoplata (Kagato Jime) that Nino Shembri said to have created.

 

We investigate in another article Jiujitsu the pioneers in Brazil and how this art has been preserved in our land and disappeared from Japan.

We here at Invictus have a simple belief: “Create a community where anyone can come in and train without fear of being injured, bullied or forced into competition”. We have stuck by this belief and now have one of the fastest growing groups in the city.

While self defense is a focus for us, we do also tend to move towards the sport and fitness aspects of the martial arts as well. We however do not require nor push our members to fight or compete. While We will gladly train you if that goal is desired but it is not our intention as a team to make you compete. We understand that everyone has their own goals and intentions when they walk through our doors. So if your intention is fitness, weight loss, competition, self defense or just a new hobby. We will gladly help you achieve these goals and any others you may decide along the way.

We understand that there are a lot of other sports clubs and gyms who offer great deals and facilities, but why lift weights or run when you can get the same workout or better from a martial art that could save your life. We here at Invictus pride ourselves on being more than just another gym. We value a team environment in order to work together to achieve common fitness, self defense and sport goals. It is far more productive to workout with a team who all help one another than to try and achieve your goals on your own. Come check us out and experience the advantage of training with us.

Self Defense:

  Those who have watched the news lately are probably well aware that Albuquerque is one of the most dangerous cities in the country. What good is pumping  iron, or taking a spin class going to do when you find yourself in one of these bad situations? While pumping iron has its benefits, weights don’t hit back! Spin classes will definitely increase your stamina, allowing you to flee the situation (which is usually your best option) but what if you have no where to run?  We give you the alternative of practical self defense and make sure you can be in control of your life, not just another statistic!

Family environment:

                At Invictus you will be treated as one of the family, as we all work together in a safe, fun and productive environment to achieve mutual goals. Our coaches are some of the best in the business. They work to ensure every lesson is both practical and efficient. We understand your time is worth a lot, so we make sure and teach our classes in the most productive, practical and efficient ways possible. 

We guarantee to have the best prices of any accredited Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or Muay Thai-Boxing academy in the city. Come see why we were voted “Best in City” by Albuquerque the Magazine. See you on the mats!

Invictus Core Values

At Invictus, we make it our goal to provide the most comfortable and welcoming training atmosphere possible for our members. This will ensure that you can train and achieve your goals in a fun carefree environment.

No one wants to receive training at a facility that doesn’t work in real life. What is the purpose of learning anything that hasn’t been proven or tested to work? ALL of our techniques in ALL of our programs are practical, useful and have been tested in real situations.

At Invictus, it is an integral part of our teaching and culture to encourage every person to help others learn. We have learned through years of training that often times it is easier to grow when more people are helping you to learn. We ask that all members on the mats make it their mission to help others grow and learn as well as themselves.

Every member in the gym and coach on our staff are all held to a high standard of respect and courtesy. No member or coach will ever be permitted to be disrespectful or discourteous to any other individual in our academy. That is not the type of atmosphere or culture we want.

An individual’s ego has no place on our mats, we are all there to learn and get better, if an individual needs to make a name for his/herself by trying to hurt another person, they will be promptly asked to leave. No exceptions.  At Invictus, we do this because we love the arts and want to share them to help others.

At Invictus, we do our best to keep open dialogues between all students  (in kids classes – Parents) and Coaches. This way students can feel free to request extra help, or provide useful insights to help us all grow as a whole. Coaches will routinely help students to achieve their goals and provide knowledge and experience to increase student capabilities.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c0.0.200.200/p200x200/600883_677128482305793_2038500982_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&_nc_eui2=v1%3AAeFM34GRRHM8acrvs4bPHbWfSPT4Xnj-nCDKGypuCqXYWQNmTFA1j8UEzdVQAQPtbswhIETiyNb7nAKWgxT_6gNzEscJcZWJzPLBbTv6vsIpEg&oh=b8c1dddb5fb22cec6839c3caa518f4d6&oe=5B482C73";"https://www.invictusmartialarts.com/kids-bjj-and-selfdefense/";"Kids BJJ Self-Defense
Our Program:
Invictus kids Jiu Jitsu and self defense focuses on not only the martial art and self defense aspect, but healthy living discipline and true anti-bullying lessons. Our coaches won’t just instruct your children on what to do or how to act,we will be an example of it. 

   We focus our weekly lessons on a topic to build our lessons around such as; diet, proper exercise, flexibility, situational awareness, leverage etc. 

    Our coaches are both knowledgeable and patient with each and every students and our teaching methods utilize more positive reinforcement and  achievement based lessons while handing out push ups or sprints for fighting, negativity or bullying.

We like to encourage parents to be involved  with our program by giving us feedback as to school performance, social issues, confidence or any other parts of their child’s life that we can help influence. 

     Our program is designed kids ages 6.5 to 13 but exceptions can be made. Come in, meet the coaches and try out a free week of classes!
What your child will need to start class:

     Long workout pants or shorts, T-shirt (preferably one not loved, as it will be gabbed)  and a good attitude.
    While we do use and require a Gi/kimono in class, parents don’t need to rush to get one. We understand they can be pricey so we allow a month of using the gym loaner uniforms before needing to obtain your own. We sell our own uniforms but you're never required to purchase ours. Most of our techniques can be modified for street clothes. We also have our own Gi distributor to give you the best price while also including team patches.

How our classes work:

    Due to the age and lack of attention most kids have when learning something technical, we build our curriculum off of exercises, games and interactive lessons. We work to maintain attention by giving students goals in class, asking for their input, and having them demonstrate the techniques and lessons they were just shown.
    We normally start our classes off with a light jog and stretches followed by team drills or Jiu-Jitsu based exercises to promote the techniques being taught. We will then jump into the lessons and give interactive break downs with the kids on the techniques ensuring their understanding. Lastly before a light free roll/sparring session, we discuss with the kids our weekly topic, which focuses on areas such as health, discipline, anti-bullying etc.
    Our free roll/sparring is a required part of our curriculum as it teaches the application of the art. It is done in a very controlled environment, where coaches can observe to make sure every student is safe.  Students are taught before any submission or joint lock to use proper control and positioning to avoid any injuries. 

Invictus Rank and Promotions

It is our belief that one of the worst things that can be done to a child’s development is to give them something they haven’t earned. For this reason all of our students are held to strict standards to achieve rank. Our coaches are highly skilled and trained to encourage, motivate and grow every child’s ability regardless of learning style, confidence level, athletic ability or body type. The art Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu takes rank extremely seriously and will not award a black belt to any individual under the age of 19 years old. We firmly believe that an individual wearing a Jiu-Jitsu black belt should be able to back up the rank not only in technical ability but emotional and intellectual maturity as well.

Each Belt rank requires 4 stripes to complete before moving on. Students must meet the following criteria for promotion:

    Class Dedication – Each stripe has a cumulative class requirement to be eligible to receive. Students must attend and participate in the classes to receive the class credit.
    Discipline – Children are responsible for being to class on time (exceptions can be made for parent schedules), Students are also responsible for maintaining their own uniform hygiene and making sure they remember their assigned tasks as well as needed equipment.
    Work ethic – students will not be rewarded for putting in low effort or complaining during activities. Work ethic is paramount to success in all activities, student’s success is directly proportional to work output.
    Respect – Whining, complaining, goofing off, hurting or putting down other students, fighting, being disruptive or any other disrespectful action will be met with consequences such as push ups or sprints given by coaches. These actions will be considered in promotion. Conversely, respect, courtesy, attention, helping one another will be rewarded.
    Technical knowledge – Students must show improvement in knowledge of curriculum taught
      application of knowledge – Students rank regarding application will be based upon their improvement from their last  promotion rank.";"https://www.invictusmartialarts.com/new-page-1/";"Women's Only
Invictus Women:  Empowering Ladies of the 505
As women in today’s society, we often face a lot of fears and constraints on what we can do; at times even believing some of the limitations imposed on us. We, as coaches and as women from various backgrounds, want to prove that women are strong. We sympathize with women who have had, and possibly still face, hard times and we understand the struggle. Our own involvement in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai has helped us recognize our strengths (physically and mentally) and grow in ways we previously never thought possible.  Together, our goal is to use BJJ and Muay Thai to empower the women of our community without pressure of a co-ed group and with support from fellow women.

WHY WOMEN’S ONLY CLASSES?

While women are welcome in all of our classes here at Invictus, we recognize that starting BJJ or Muay Thai can be intimidating, especially if you’re new to martial arts. The purpose of our women’s program is to provide women with an introduction to BJJ and Muay Thai in an environment that’s safe, supportive, and fun. This is a program by women, for women.  We aim to share our love for BJJ and Muay Thai while teaching practical self-defense skills that are applicable in the real world. 

WHAT TO EXPECT?

    Beginner classes taught by women, for women
    No prior experience or athletic ability required to start
    A friendly environment
    Progress at your own pace/intensity
    A workout that challenges your mind and body
    A place to reach your own personal goals and be comfortable while doing so

WHAT DO I WEAR?

    BJJ: Form-fitting workout clothes (like a sports bra with a rashguard or tight t-shirt and compression shorts/capris) that do not have any pockets or loose straps.  This is to help prevent any injury caused by getting fingers snagged in the loose clothing
    Muay Thai: comfortable workout clothing
    Tie back long hair in a ponytail, braid, or bun.
    Keep your nails trimmed short to avoid scratching your training partners
    Please no jewelry, bobby pins, hair clips, zippers, etc. as they can be dangerous to you and your partner.
    Due to the nature of grappling and Muay Thai clinch work, we recommend removing makeup before class so that it doesn’t end up on your training partner’s clothes.
    Mouthguards are recommended for both BJJ & Muay Thai, but not required
    BJJ classes will be taught using the gi, but you may borrow a loaner gi or get started without one.
    Feel free to bring your own Muay Thai gear if you have them, if not we do have gear to provide

BJJ:

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a grappling sport,often taught in police forces and many self defense courses. In fact, BJJ can be found globally, often starting as a hobby and then transformed into a lifestyle by practitioners. Jiu Jitsu is a great way to get in shape, a way to build confidence and is also a great sport to compete and challenge yourself in if you choose.  Being a dynamic sport, as well as a physical one, practitioners gain strength, flexibility, and endurance on a whole body and mind scale. In our class we will focus on BJJ fundamentals, core/strength drills, self defense tactics, and being able to apply these skills practically and safely.

Muay Thai:
Muay Thai, translated into English as Thai Boxing, is the national sport of Thailand and is a martial art with origins in the ancient battlefield tactics of the Siamese (or Thai) army.  It evolved from Krabi-Krabong, literally sword and baton, the hand-to-hand tactics of the Thai army.  The early Muay Thai bouts pitted different companies within the Siamese army against each other with few rules and no weight divisions or time limits.  They became quite popular and eventually were shown in stadia across the country.  In the early 20th century, time limits, boxing gloves as well as a uniform set of rules were introduced.  During the latter half of the 20th century Muay Thai was exported to many countries and is now practiced by hundreds of thousands of people all over the world.

Muay Thai is known as “King of the Ring” in kickboxing circles.  These fights feature punches, kicks, elbows, knees, standing grappling and head-butts to wear down and knock out their opponent.  Thai training methods develop devastating power, speed and superb cardio-vascular endurance as well as fighting spirit.  Muay Thai  training as also quite safe thanks to sophisticated pad training that evolved to keep fighters healthy between fights.  Muay Thai has also proven very effective outside the ring and has been embraced enthusiastically by practitioners of a variety of self-defense, sporting, military and law enforcement activities.

Muay Thai originates from Thailand and is a stand up martial art utilizing striking and clinch work. Muay Thai is referred to as the art of the eight limbs because it encompasses knees, elbows, kicks and punches.


Here at Invictus we are a group of career orientated instructors and students. We understand the need to stay injury free and do not place an emphasis on fighting. We do offer our students the opportunity to step into the ring if they would like to but it is not a requirement. Our Muay Thai instructors are experienced in the ring and out, training all around the world, including Thailand.

In the United States, every month over 3 million children miss school due to a fear of bullies. The Bully Prevention Program we teach here at the New Mexico Jiu-Jitsu Academy is designed to instill such confidence in your child they will be able to overcome bullies without the need to resort to violence. Of course, if the unthinkable happens and a bully does attack your child, they will be well prepared for that too.

Step 1 (Physical Self-Defense)

We utilize a multi-layered approach when teaching your child how to handle a bully. The first step is to teach them how to defend themselves against a physical attack. This will provide your child with the confidence they need so they can stand up to the bully before it ever reaches the point of physical violence.  Your child will learn defensive tactics from the martial art known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. They will learn leverage based techniques that will allow a smaller child to defend themselves against an attack from a much larger bully.  These techniques never require your child to punch or kick the bully as often times that can cause more harm than good.
Step 2 (Mental/Verbal Self-Defense)

Once your child has the confidence to defend themselves physically, we next teach them how to defend themselves mentally. Verbal bullying is a much larger, more common, and in many ways a much more dangerous form of bullying than is physical bullying.  All too often verbal bullying can lead to fear, anxiety, depression and sadly even suicide. Therefore, we take it very seriously! We teach your child when to stand up to the bully, what to say to the bully, and even how to say what they need to say. Step by step we give your child all the tools they will ever need in order to successfully stand up to a bully.
Step 3 (Character Development)

The last step is to teach your child how to be a positive role model for other children.  The skill of self-defense is an invaluable tool that children should never take lightly.  Therefore, we teach them rules they must follow so they will never abuse their power and become bullies themselves. Every day we also discuss with them different aspects of personal character development because our goal is to help your child grow into healthy, well balanced, young adults. We discuss with them a wide range of topics such as: responsibility, respect, humility, manners, healthy eating, good citizenship, caring for others, proper hygiene, and the list goes on and on.
Little Champs Class (4-7 Years Old)

At this age children are often too young to understand the value of learning martial arts. All they want to do is play and have fun. Therefore, we give them exactly what they want, we “play” Jiu-Jitsu with them! The New Mexico Jiu-Jitsu Academy has numerous Jiu-Jitsu games which secretly teach your children the foundation of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  These games will develop their reflexes so they will be able to execute the fundamental techniques of BJJ if they ever need to use them and once they have mastered the games or become of age they will be promoted to the Jr. Grapplers Class.
Jr. Grapplers Class (8-13 Years Old)

This is the age group where bullying is the most prevalent, therefore this is when we spend the most amount of time incorporating our Bully Prevention Program. In this class they will learn nearly all of the techniques taught in the Adult Gracie Jiu-Jitsu class (Grand Master’s Fundamentals).  The purpose of the curriculum is to teach your child how to defend themselves from any type of physical attack. Without ever having to throw a single punch or kick they will be able to neutralize a bully’s attack and establish control over them until help arrives.  With these powerful tools under their belt, they no longer have to live in fear. They will gain more confidence than ever before and self-confidence is by far the single most effective deterrent to bullies.
Black Belt Club (Instructor Recommendation Only)

Once your child is confident in the techniques they learned in the Jr Grapplers Class they will be eligible for the Black Belt Club.  This is a preparatory course that will enable a smooth transition into the adult class at 14 years of age.  In this class they will learn techniques beyond what’s taught in the Jr. Grapplers Class. They will also learn how to apply the techniques they do know effectively against a resisting opponent (aka Sparring) and it will set them on the right path for their journey to the black belt.";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay Thai";"N/A";"http://www.nmjiujitsu.com/class-schedule/";"Monday: 4:00 PM - 9:00 PM

The children practice strength building bag work, safe sparring, and real life self defense moves that make them feel empowered to protect themselves. Fear is paralyzing and it can affect a person's ability to defend themselves, however, if your child is prepared with rehearsed situations their chances for becoming a victim to bullies, child molesters or unsafe individuals will be greatly reduced by giving them the natural programming to defend themselves in any given situation.

Children, who train at Sigala's Martial Arts, learn much more than kicking and punching. These children learn the importance of goal setting, self-discipline and, hard work that can be applied to all areas of their life. Most kids probably will not compete in the ring, but by practicing the Martial Arts, they will build the necessary skills and confidence to become champions of life.

However, most fans don't know that Coach Wink also operates a family gym for beginners and intermediate level Martial Artists, spending several evenings a week here at Wink's Gym MMA & Fitness. Wink's Gym as it is known, is owned by Coach Wink and his wife, Heather Winkeljohn.
Coach Wink spent the better part of 30 years teaching martial arts to families and kids in the Albuquerque area. The problem that we found with many martial arts programs is the lack of application. Here, the students, and especially kids are allowed to actually do the things they learn; albeit safely and with control. That means yes, they actually spar and grapple. One skill is built upon the other, and kids learn to problem solve and look for solutions. The idea or hope is that they can then begin to apply this skills in real life.

"Presti Karate Centers";"http://www.prestikarate.com/";" +1 716-285-9242";"2809 Pine Ave";"Niagara Falls";"NY";14301;;"United States";"Presti Karate started as Kim Studio, back in 1966. by Mr Pat Johnson, Master Presti's first instructor. When Mr Johnson left Niagara Falls, His brother Joe, and Tony Pedulla continued the same quality instruction as Pat Johnson had. Master Presti came into the picture during his fighting career, he joined forces with Joe Presti and Tony Pedulla, only to buy out Tony's share of the business. Joe left the business in 1984 to further his insurance profession. Tony Pedulla became a Bus driver and is currentely retired and still works out at Presti's Fitness every morning.
In 1983 Kim studio took on the name of Presti School of Karate, which is now known as Presti Karate Centers. With 3 locations, 2809 Pine ave. In Niagara Falls, 225 Portage Rd in Lewiston and our newest location, 1000 Civic Plaza in Corning , N.Y.
The most common question to Master Presti is How is that you became a part of UFAF. It all started in 1979 when John Presti contacted Mr Johnson in California, because he and Joe felt that they platued, and no where to go and wanted to learn more. Mr Johnson was very impressed with them that they didn't do what everyone else did, promote themselves. He said that Mr Chuck Norris's organization is looking for good Black belts who want to learn. The rest was history. Presti Karate is Niagara's most prestigious schools, opened since 1970 over 40 years of service to the Niagara Falls Community.
Mr Presti, still provides to his student the highest level of training. And he still gets promotions himself, a sure sign that he and his staff are on the right road. He is the highest rank black belt on the East Coast of North America in Chun Kuk Do.

Presti Karate recognied as School of the Year from Grand Master Chuck Norris on July 18th 2009

I own and operate Jungle Gym Martial Arts here in New Rochelle, and for years I’ve worked my tail off trying to help our kids beat the streets. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has been tried and tested in martial arts tournaments for decades, and most recent in no-holds barred promotions like the UFC.  The reason why I use Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as the basis for my Kids MMA program is because with Jiu-Jitsu you can control a situation.

Without the use of violence!

With a curriculum focusing on position control and escapes, The Jungle Gym will teach your child how to “push someone away” or “hold someone down” as a first resort, rather than the barbaric “gauge him in the eyes/kick him in the groin” approach that most traditional martial arts take. In our Kids MMA program, violence is taught to be avoided at all costs, and minimized when necessary. In an ever-growing world of lawsuits and zero-tolerance policies, we understand the need to equip our children with the right tools to defend themselves.  Why teach them brutal, destructive techniques that can’t be trained full force, when Jiu-jitsu is safer and more effective anyway? We don’t cater to the natural athletes or the “Coach’s kid” here.  At the Jungle Gym we know that every child can be a champion…. And we are committed to give each one of them the attention and instruction to bring out their best.

Let’s save our kids from the streets!

The Jungle Gym has battled to help kids beat the streets for years.  It’s the combination of our award-winning

Life Skills Program and our commitment to making kids succeed that has us winning the “War against quitting!”
Life is hard and our kids need the tools to help them get over the hump.The numbers speak for themselves:

    More than Half of NY’s high school students DROP OUT!
     Most kids who don’t drop out take more than 4 years  to graduate!
    Private schools average $15 thousand a year!

Now don’t get me wrong, great parenting can go a long way, but in our age of single parent households—or with two parents who are forced to work to try and get ahead, not every parent has the time to think straight, let alone spend the hours a day necessary to instill major life skills like:

    Discipline
    Perseverance
    Determination
    Teamwork
Well, I have a suggestion for all you hard-working, well-intentioned parents:

 Let the Jungle Gym help!

Call us right now.  Let our full-time, professional

team make your child a success!

Look, I know you want the best for your child, and never has it been more important for

kids to get the head start on life that they deserve!  I, being a parent myself, understand that and am here to help!

With our Mixed Martial Arts Program, your child will learn:

    Confidence
    Self Respect
    Courtesy
    Discipline
    Concentration

The list goes on an on!  And that’s not all—your child will do all this at the

ECF's Youth Muay Thai Program is designed to instill the techniques of traditional Muay Thai, to strengthen students' listening skills and patience, build confident young people with strong character, and to make sure the students enjoy themselves.

Class format varies, but always includes:

Instructor:

Coach Skip has extensive experience coaching youth athletics and years of study of the art of Muay Thai. At ECF, he has found his specialty as Youth Muay Thai Instructor. Skip believes in maximizing each student's potential, through focused attention to individual technique and utilizing teaching methods that aim to touch each of his students' different learning styles.

""The art of muay thai is deeply rewarding. I love to see my students grow and develop not only their martial arts skills, but also their spirit, self-confidence, and pride of accomplishment. My favorite moments in class are the breakthroughs, where that puzzle piece clicks into place and a student suddenly ""gets it"": not only how to perform a technique with precision, but why, and at what moment that technique is most useful. It sharply increases their hunger to learn - they get the great feeling of having met the challenge of learning something new and putting it into real-world context.""

We are currently located in SUITE 6 in the Atlantic Business Center at 8421 Old Statesville Road Charlotte, NC. Look for the green and white buildings, and the Royce Gracie logo in the window.Our Charlotte location is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu School. Focusing on take downs (Judo and Wrestling) and what happens once the fight hits the ground (BJJ and Submission Wrestling).

Endorsed by Mike Swain (4 Time Judo Olympian), our 1,200 sq ft Dollamur mat area is the same waterproof, hygienic canvas material that can be found in some of the top academies across the country. The mats are thoroughly cleaned with a hospital-grade disinfectant after every practice. We have a changing area, bathrooms and a full service Pro-Shop (coming soon).";"http://ftwbjjacademy.com/wp-content/themes/blue/images/FTW-logo-circle-white.png";"http://ftwbjjacademy.com/kids-class/";"FIGHT TO WIN KIDS

The Fight To Win kids program is centered around the Gracie Self-Defense system developed by Grand Master Helio Gracie over the past century.

Here children will learn basics in Jiu-Jitsu, judo, striking, self-discipline, personal wellness, and self-respect. Through careful instruction and functional games, children will learn the skills they need to build character and grow into budding young adults.
 Why Should Your Child Learn Gracie Jiu Jitsu?

Unlike traditional striking martial arts that rely on strength and size, the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu concept of leverage allows students to defeat much larger and stronger opponents. This coupled with the fact that most fights, including confrontations with bullies, end up on the ground, makes Jiu-Jitsu the most effective martial art for children.

Class sizes are small enough that every child is getting a lot of personal attention. Enroll your children now to take advantage of this valuable and potentially life-saving opportunity to learn Gracie Jiu Jitsu from the only Royce Gracie certified Black Belt school in the Charlotte area.

A personal note from Steve Hall. “Kids are the future. I have two young boys as well, so I understand that it is a hard decision to choose your child’s path in life. Being part of the FTW team is being part of a bigger family. Our goal is to help your child grow into a happy healthy young adult, and have a lot of fun doing it. BJJ is not just something to do, it is a lifestyle.”

Stranger danger, bully busters, age appropriate self defense techniques, and much more. We teach these concepts in a non-threatening environment through games, discussion and practice, with the comfort of parental involvement and trustworthy teachers.  

Character Development
Striving to develop a good character is the facet that separates martial arts from other fitness programs and sporting activities.  Stories, games and other activities are used to reinforce positive character development and learning. 

Physical Development
While students are having fun with games and activities, they are developing motor skills appropriate for their age. This includes coordination skills, right and left side development, flexibility, muscle strength, timing, speed and mobility. 

Mental Growth
We teach through interactive lessons. We do not lecture, rather we make sure to get everyone involved, making learning both easier and more fun! Everything we teach is age specific to encourage learning and mental growth.  

Self-Confidence
Our curriculum is based on short term goals. By rewarding the achievement of many small goals over time the students build confidence and establish higher goals, not just in Martial Arts training but in all aspects of life.  

Leadership
The Little Ninjas program is designed to build a groundwork for developing our students into future leaders. With the confidence, social skills, self-esteem, and discipline your child will develop, they are laying a foundation beyond what most 'normal' sports provide.

Learning a martial art, and Brazilian jiu jitsu in particular, is one of the best gifts you­ can provide a child. It provides character development and personal growth that will impact every area of their life, for the rest of their life. It is a fun way for kids to get into fantastic shape, gain confidence, learn respect, improve discipline, and prevent bullying.

Our kids program operates in a fun and nurturing environment, where kids flourish and learn important life lessons like:

    Through self-discipline, commitment, and perseverance, you can accomplish anything.
    Improving focus and concentration helps you ignore distractions and fully engage in lessons at school, in sport, and at home.
    Patience pays off.
    When you are healthy and fit, you feel better about yourself and are more confident.

Bullying

Our Kids Program will also empower your kids to prevent or discourage bullying without violence. Through appropriate and effective self-defense techniques, we instill the self-esteem and confidence needed to allow kids to defuse confrontations before they escalate, and how to protect and defend themselves in the event they are attacked. Bullying is the #1 social issue and epidemic in schools today, and it has ripple effects throughout our communities.

    Every 7 minutes a child is bullied in the US
    Every month, 3 million children miss school due to fear of bullying
    90% of 4th through 8th graders report being victims of bullying
    1 out of 10 students drop out of school due to repeated bullying
    70% of students believe schools respond poorly to bullying and that adult help is infrequent

Don’t let your child be a victim!
Why is the core of our program based in Brazilian jiu jitsu?

    It does not rely on strength or size, so is effective against larger and stronger attackers,
    It is safe because it’s focused on restraint and control rather than striking, and
    It is considered the most practical and effective self-defense system in the world.

Brazilian jiu jitsu is the martial art used in “Bully-Proofing” programs that have been praised by Oprah, CNN, and parents worldwide.

In 1996, Greg Thompson received his blue belt from Royce Gracie and opened one of the first Gracie Jiu-Jitsu network Schools on the East coast. At that time there were only three blue belts in the Carolinas. In 1997, Brent Pierce started training with Greg in Jiu-jitsu as he was running a successful school called California Combat Concepts (CCC). Brent had been putting on boxing and kickboxing events. Some of the first MMA events ever held on the east coast were by Brent over the Virginia line because it was illegal in North Carolina at that time. Greg’s students were in the first MMA events and dominated. In 1998, Greg changed the name of his school to the Academy of Mixed Martial Arts (AMMA) where he offered Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. Brent started having Greg do monthly seminars at his school and Greg became their Grappling coach. In 1999, they decided to start fighting under the same name, Team R.O.C.( Realty of Combat). This was a name they were using to train law enforcement and military together as a team. In 2004 Royce Gracie invited over 100 of his top student to Team R.O.C. and gave out his first Black Belts, to Greg and four other students. Over the past several years Team R.O.C. students have opened up schools all over the east coast.

Some of Greg’s students that started with him in the 1990’s as white and blue belts are now Black Belts and have their own Team ROC School: Spencer Canup, Jason Culbreth, Billy Dowey, Jason Palacios, Brian Mingie, Brandon Garner, Mazi Heydary

Team R.O.C. has been featured in MMA Worldwide Magazine

Team-ROC fighters have appeared in some of the top shows in the world including: K1, UFC, IFL, StrikeForce, King of the Cage, Bodog Fights, and HDNET Fights.

Some Pro-Fighters from Team R.O.C. Tim Kennedy (185) Jason Palacios (155) Aitor Canup (185)
Brandon Garner (145) Tara Larosa (135)

Team R.O.C. has approximately 15 schools across the east coast. Team ROC currently has 8 black belts under Royce Gracie and continues to develop top level competitors.";"http://files.ctctcdn.com/1472d0f4101/27496388-213a-4e8e-8ae3-1cb5355394a5.jpg";"http://www.teamroc.net/programs/kids/";"Ages 4-12

Deeds, not words.

This is the mantra that drives of the spirit of the Academy of Combat Arts. Founded by esteemed MMA fighter and trainer Dylan Spicer in 2009, the ACA has grown into one of the premier martial arts gyms in the upper Midwest. No other facility in the Fargo-Moorhead area has trained more nationally-recognized fighters nor offers a comparable level of teaching expertise. This isn’t hyperbole either; our gym has sent two fighters to compete on the reality television show The Ultimate Fighter, including former UFC fighter Pablo Garza.

Spicer, who himself claims an undefeated 8-0 record in competitive mixed martial arts, is committed to empowering every student at the Academy of Combat Arts to achieve their personal goals. As someone who once drove over five hours from Grand Forks, ND to Brooklyn Park, Minn. to attend the Academy, training under acclaimed mixed martial artist Greg Nelson, he understands the drive and commitment it takes to attain excellence. His fellow instructors similarly share this spirit of determination, and seek to pass it on to their students at the ACA.

Our facility features a full ring and cage, in addition to an ample amount of floor mat space for our students to train at their best. We offer our classes six days a week, with available times to suit diverse schedules. Men and women of all ages are welcome to pursue their martial arts goals with us, whether their interest is in recreation, exercise, or training for competition.

Located at 3433 4th Ave S, the ACA also offers a convenient central location in the Fargo-Moorhead metro area, and is easily accessible by interstate for out-of-town students. For the casual enthusiast and the professional fighter alike, the ACA offers a welcoming atmosphere to develop your skills, get in shape, and meet like-minded martial artists who will support you in your goals.

We will be running programs focused on men, women and youth with the goal of building a complete program for all customers. The company is comprised of likeminded entrepreneurs who are passionate about helping people understand what needs to be done to increase and/or preserve the values of martial arts, health and wellness and protecting yourself and loved ones while enabling ourselves to do the same.
Our goal is to empower people to take health, wellness and safety to others driving a culture that benefits everyone. Ronin Training Center will use all instructor lead training to provide students with the confidence and tools to accomplish their goals.

We currently employ trainers that are professional athletes sharing their sport and their cultures to better the students and with Ronin Training Center’s plan to create a city by city culture for martial arts and fitness. These instructors range from a Professional UFC fighter, World Champion BJJ Black Belt, and Olympic Medalists and certifications from around the world in disciplines including Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and MMA. By using these athletes and a predefined program Ronin Training Center will be able to generate the demand for services much like the countries of the sports origin creating an overall culture in Central Ohio.

​

Before you can get the people you must create a world class facility to bring the instructors. Ronin Training Center has built out a facility like no other in Central Ohio by bringing the necessities of Muay Thai, Karate, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and so much more all under one roof. Our facility contains 3,000 square feet of dedicated training equipment from mats to punching bags, rowers and weights along with many day to day materials required by our instructors.

Kids Kickboxing Schedule 
*starting Monday, April 3rd

Monday's/ Friday's 5pm-6pm
It is a well-known fact that children need guidance in their life not only coming from their parents but also from an external source. We live in times which force parents to spend less time parenting and way too much worrying about the development and safety of their offspring. Sport classes are great for exercising and focusing the child’s attention but I believe that they fall short when compared to martial arts. The missing link in this case would be also covering the spiritual aspect – believing that both psychological and physical, can be strengthened simultaneously.

​

Signing the youngsters in a form of martial art has been a go-to move for decades among the parental bodies in order to get some aid in the endeavor of raising capable men and women who one day will grow up to be valuable contributing members of our society.

Ronin Training Center of Columbus Ohio respects all forms of martial arts. But we have found that Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo have worked extremely well with children to teach them the basic important foundations for living in society: Respect. Discipline. Power. Control. And Humility.

The main goal in this art is ALWAYS being aware and controlling the situation. Bjj prides itself on the usage of technique and leverage above everything. That is why it is called – “the gentle art”. The main concept is that you must shorten the distance between you and your opponent and initiate the clinch. Next you use various trips, throws and takedowns to bring the altercation to the ground. Once getting there, certain dominant positions and holds are used by the person versed in grappling to control the attacker.


Generally speaking not many systems of self-defense allow the smaller and more times than not – the weaker person to subdue a larger opponent. As a result your child will not be thought to depend on size nor strength. Practitioners learn to defend themselves and control their opponent even without trading punches or using finishing holds that might get you in trouble with the school or the legal system. What you are doing is simply nullifying the potential of the other person inflict harm on you. In my opinion this is the ultimate anti-bullying tool. Having the opportunity to harm someone but choosing not to and making them aware of it.

​

What is even better is that children learn all these attributes including balance, reflexes, flexibility and weight distribution while playing and having fun. Most academies form the teaching and sparring sessions in a form of a game so self-defense and play time are mixed in together in a very friendly environment. But I always say that if the only thing you learned out of your training in a combat sport is how to defend yourself and nothing more…you are clearly doing something wrong.

​

Here are some more significant values and lessons which your child will surely be exposed to while training :

    Self-Discipline and Responsibility

    Respect

    Finding Peaceful Solutions to Problems

    Self-Esteem and Confidence

    Setting Goals and Acting on Fulfilling Them

    Belonging Somewhere
     
We have found these and many other benefits of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo have brought even troubled children into a different world of respect and trust.

Muay Thai Kickboxing – Kids

Muay Thai boxing is a martial art accessible to people of all ages, including children (girls and boys). Following a suitable course in Muay Thai training, youngsters will benefit enormously from the inevitable physical and mental improvements. Muay Thai boxing will improve a child’s self-confidence and self-awareness. As well as keep them quick and agile, healthy and strong.

Benefits of Muay Thai Kickboxing for Kids:

    Direction: Kids participating in Muay Thai Kickboxing learn how to set goals, the knowledge necessary, and to do the work needed to achieve them. Muay Thai Kickboxing is a structured program with belts acknowledging personal achievement. Belts display both effort, time, and experience in training.
    Fitness: Participating in Muay Thai Kickboxing will improve the overall fitness level of kids who attend class regularly. Kids engage in a series of conditioning, stretching and strength exercises as part of their regular training. The program is designed to be progressive so each student progresses at their own speed. Consistent training produces better muscle tone, strength, and flexibility. Benefits derived from training include a lower percentage of body fat, increased energy, and enthusiasm for physical activity.
    Coordination: Muay Thai Kickboxing contains a progressive series of movements that improves the coordination of participants. Training in Muay Thai Kickboxing requires learning striking techniques and putting them together in a string of movement. This combination develops both specific and sequential improvement in the coordination of the body.
    Confidence: Training in Muay Thai Kickboxing improves the confidence of kids that will carry over into all venues of their lives. Through a series of challenges kids learn how to approach new situations and successfully navigate them. Challenges are progressive, and graduated, becoming more challenging at each step of the program. This format produces a foundation of self-trust and a willingness to approach challenges. The success which develops produces the confidence needed to achieve more challenging goals in the future as well.
    Self-Esteem: Kids develop enhanced self-esteem as an outcome of consistent training in Muay Thai Kickboxing. The success that kids experience as part of their training builds a self-respect that translates into self-esteem. They learn to trust, respect, and like themselves for who they are. The self-esteem they develop is strong and durable because it is based on achievement. Enhanced self-esteem will impact positively on how they relate to others, authority, and themselves.
    Self-Defense: Although most students of Muay Thai Kickboxing do it for the sport, kids learn valuable self-defense skills as well. Kids training in Muay Thai Kickboxing not only learn how to defend themselves in various situations, but develop the confidence that helps them to avoid many of the bully traps. Kids trained in the striking arts learn how to avoid, evade, and escape from many physical confrontations so common to the young. Self-defense is only one of the many benefits of Muay Thai Kickboxing, but it is a valuable benefit for kids none the less.

Rodriguez as a center for the practice of Budō and Japanese cultural arts.

Instruction is offered in three areas of martial art: Yamate Ryū Aikijutsu, Tenshin Ryū Kenjutsu, and Genwakai Karate-dō. In each of these arts, a student strives for enlightenment through a strict series of physical and mental exercises. Although the arts may seem very different to an outsider, they lead to the same goal.  Additional activities such as Kantei (Japanese sword evaluation) are available by appointment only. Prospective students are encouraged to attend one free class, in any of the styles taught at Ohio Budōkan. For more information visit the respective pages above.

The founder of Ohio Budōkan, Mr. James Rodriguez, has trained in martial arts since 1973, taught since 1977, and been awarded teaching licenses in Kenjutsu, Aikijutsu, and Genwakai Karate-dō.  Mr. Rodriguez is currently the head of Genwakai America.  All of the instructors at Ohio Budōkan hold teaching licenses in their respective arts and have at least 15 years of experience.

Ohio Budōkan offers instruction in Nippon Karate-dō Genwakai for children, ages 8 years and older. The purpose of the children's karate class is to develop the whole child with instruction centered on development of the four key areas: physical, mental, social, and emotional. The instruction is dedicated to character development rather than competition. Children are taught and evaluated based on their own individual progression and taught the traditional qualities of self-respect, self-discipline, self-motivation, respect for others, respect for authority, initiative, and achievement. Classes are structured to promote these qualities in a safe and secure environment.

Classes will begin with stretching and strengthening exercises prior to a period in which basic techniques are reinforced. Groups are then formed by rank and instructors focus on improving established techniques and teaching new techniques or prearranged sets of movements. Genwakai Karate is a style that can be mastered by the average student within a relatively short period of time depending on attendance, ability, and effort.

To a Dayton resident ready for a
thrilling, fun, & fulfilling experience,

There are a few simple things that make a good martial arts school a great one. We work our hardest every day to fulfill those things, and give our students the best experience we possibly can. Here's what it takes, and what you can expect when you walk through our doors for the first time:

Knowledgeable, Passionate Instructors.
When hand-picking our instructors, we look for a few key traits: passion for martial arts, passion for teaching, a great personality, and expertise. Our instructors truly care about you and your experience. They're here for every question you have and every challenge that arises.

They'll push you to try your hardest, and motivate you to surpass your limits. Nothing beats having a great teacher - and we have the best.

A Clean, Up-to-Date Facility.
The best teachers in the world won't make up for a dirty facility with run-down equipment. That's why, every day, we thoroughly clean our studio from top to bottom. And we check our equipment to make sure it's in good working order, and replace it when it needs replacing.

Community.
Finally, it takes the right people to make an amazing community. The environment of our school attracts people who are open-minded, enjoy socializing with one another, and enjoy having fun. The parents whose kids train with us are caring and supportive. The adults who train with us are kind and fun. It's like a family here, and we'd love for you to become a part of it.

Browse around our website and learn about our programs. When you find the one that's right for you, you can sign up for a trial online and get started asap. Call and let us know if you have any questions. And I can't wait to meet you in person.

Limitless Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is an affiliated Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academy of the Vitor Oliveira Fight Team and the Grappling Fight Team(GFTeam). The lineage of our head instructor and of the association to which we belong descends from the Oswalda Fadda Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu lineage. We are one of the few lineages who Jiu-Jitsu comes from the same time as the Gracie Families but from a different family of Brazil. We are equally capable of our counterparts but descend from a different family of equally rich history and tradition.

The intent of our academy is to give back to the community what Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has given to us. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a much deeper art than most people realize. On the surface we award belts, compete for medals, and teach self-defense. But the reality is Jiu-Jitsu is about a more profound message. We teach people to believe in themselves. Jiu-Jitsu is not an activity you participate in that stops when you leave the gym. To truly be good at Jiu-Jitsu you must adopt a mindset and an attitude of self-belief that you carry with you everywhere in life. This is what Jiu-Jitsu has given to us as a community and we are here to share it with you.

While we are first and foremost a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu based academy we still offer (or plan to) offer other disciplines. As the school continues to expand and enrollment increases, class volume and variety will increase and diversify.

Tallmadge Ave";"Akron";"OH";44310;;"United States";"The GT Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy started in   Tallmadge on May 5th, 2014, and moved to the current Akron location in September of 2016. Head Instructors are Nova Uniao Black Belts, Todd Meighen and Gregory Hammerton. They were awarded their Black Belts from their longtime Instructor Eduardo ""Dudu"" Barros on May 6, 2013. The school was formerly known as the ""Dudu Barros Jiu-Jitsu Academy"". The name may be new, but the school has been around the Northeast Ohio area since the late 1990's.     

Eduardo ""Dudu"" Barros grew up in Brazil, and began training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at 11 years old. He started at the Carlson Gracie Academy in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,  training under the legendary Carlson Gracie Sr. He eventually began training with one of Carlson's top students, Andre Pederneiras. Eduardo received his Black Belt from Andre in 2005. Andre Pederneiras is the leader of the Nova Uniao Team in Rio. The Nova Uniao Team is home to former UFC Champions Jose Aldo and Renan Barao, and current Bellator Champ Eduardo Dantas. 

In 1997 ""Dudu"" relocated to the United States and created the Dudu Barros Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy. The first school was located in his parents' basement. The school continued to grow over the years, and ""Dudu"" relocated the school several times throughout the Akron area. In early 2014, Eduardo decided that he wanted to pursue other interests in his life, and he decided to hand over the reigns of the Academy to Todd and Gregg. The Academy was renamed GT Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with Eduardo's blessing. 

New name, new location, but the same great quality of instruction! Todd and Gregg are excited to continue Eduardo's hard work!";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/dd8a29_1aaa4c7624a047318966508c8fbeb47e~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_728,h_208,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/dd8a29_1aaa4c7624a047318966508c8fbeb47e~mv2.jpg";"https://www.gtbjjohio.com/kids-bjj";"Aimed at kids ages 6-15 yrs old, the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Kids Program integrates physical education and self-defense technique with conditioning and skill-building games aimed at improving coordination, motor skills, agility and flexibility. Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the only Martial Art that will teach your child practical and proven self-defense techniques that can work in real life situations, even against a larger or more physically strong aggressor. Unlike other Martial Arts like Karate or Tae Kwon Do, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu advocates for minimal punches and kicks in self defense settings. This asset makes our martial art an ideal choice for children as it teaches the student to control the situation through grappling without the need for strikes. We will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies, without turning them into one!

 

Our program helps young students develop important character traits and values, including:

​

• Excel in Academics & Athletics
• Boosting Self Esteem and Confidence
• Goal Setting/Achieving
• Discipline
• Leadership Qualities
• Responsibility

 

Unlike instruction given at ""McDojos"", Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training does not foster a false sense of accomplishment. BJJ teaches personal accountability and responsibility for rank advancement. Our program does not promote students simply for ""participation"". Life doesn't hand out ribbons or trophies just for showing up, and BJJ helps them to understand that the real world, like Jiu-Jitsu training, will only reward them for their own hard work and dedication to achieving their goals. Students progress through the ranking system through the judgement of the instructor and is based on attitude, work ethic and understanding of the concepts displayed in class. There is no test. It takes years to progress through each belt and they must be earned and evaluated using a large number of both relative and fixed standards. In fact, the informality and high standards of Jiu-Jitsu is something that is very characteristic of the art itself. THERE ARE NO 10 YEAR OLD BLACK BELTS HERE!  Any school that has a Black Belt under the age of 18, is definitely not looking out for the best interest of the parent or child. Most schools are just trying to take your money! We aren't selling belts, we are selling knowledge, safety, and piece of mind to the parents.";"https://www.gtbjjohio.com/female-strong";"FEMALE STRONG

Can Women learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu? Absolutely! Women can safely experience the benefits of learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, even if they have little or no experience in sports or Martial Arts. As a Martial Art designed to allow the weaker to defeat the stronger, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a perfect fit for women who are interested in learning how to protect themselves. Female Strong classes are designed to introduce women to the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in a fun, relaxed environment. Most Martial Arts classes are male dominated, and this can be intimidating for Women. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu can be even more intimidating because of the close personal contact involved while learning the techniques. Women may feel uncomfortable training with a male, may be afraid of injury or they may feel so intimidated that they don't even want to try a class. However, seeing a class full of women training can be more inviting and put a beginner more at ease.  This allows females to accelerate their learning by training with other women, similar in size, and by eliminating some of the difficulties that beginner women face training with men. This class will empower Women to learn how to protect themselves, but it is also a great form of exercise. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu students will notice an increase in flexibility, muscle strength, endurance, and general well being.

My name is Dale “Apollo” Cook and I am the owner of Apollo's Martial Arts. When I was a child, I began my martial arts journey and the positive impact it had on my life was remarkable. It was always my dream to someday own my own school and when I opened Apollo's Martial Arts in 1982, I made a commitment to our community in Tulsa to create an enjoyable environment for students to improve their fitness while building confidence they can carry into their everyday lives. It is my privilege and honor to take the the knowledge I have received in my own martial arts training and pass it on to the students at my school.

MARTIAL ARTS IS NOT JUST KICKS AND PUNCHES!

We teach all our members to focus on and be present in the moment - and in this age of distractions and sensory overload, this is a skill which returns immediate results in all aspects of one's life.  Here are some interesting facts about Apollo's Martial Arts:

    Our members are from all walks of life; we have students, attorneys, doctors, engineers, military and law enforcement all training in a fun, team oriented family environment;
     
    We have kids that have been training for years that leave to top colleges and universities in the country, thanks in part to the discipline and focus on hard work they learned through martial arts.  This is something we take a great amount of pride in. 
     
    There are always new generations of individuals and families coming in to pursue the ongoing legacy.  It is a tradition in martial arts to pass down the knowledge one receives in their training and many students become instructors, often ending up owning their own schools.  

It is our goal to inspire strength, discipline, confidence and focus in our students, to help them discover the leader that is within them.  I believe every child has the potential to be a leader, they just need someone to believe in them. As a parent myself, I understand the challenges of raising a confident and focused child in an age where there are more distractions than ever.

And while the kids have their fun, our adult program is second to none.  From traditional martial arts to more modern self-defense styles, there is something for everyone at Apollo's Martial Arts.  If you are looking to burn major calories, learn self-defense moves and get in the best shape of your life, you must come and check out our adult program.

Imagine yourself as a stronger, more confident individual in the best shape of your life. I want to personally invite you to take advantage of our introductory trial offer, and turn that vision into a reality.  

It would be a privilege to meet you and your child to have them step into the wonderful world of martial arts.";"https://apolloskarate.com/upload/ApollosMA-Logo.png";"https://apolloskarate.com/programs/children-classes/little-dragons";"3-5 Yrs

THE BENEFITS OF MARTIAL ARTS ARE LIFE-CHANGING!

Martial arts sometimes get a bad rap. People often falsely associate it solely with Hollywood kicks and punches, but fail to realize that the main thing martial arts teach is life skills. While self-defense is one aspect, martial arts goes far beyond that. Not only does it help develop self-confidence and self-esteem, it also builds a sense of respect for others and encourages non-violent conflict resolution! Martial arts teach socialization skills to diffuse tense situations rather than actively engage in them.

Accommodations include 5 changing rooms, 2 bathrooms, a shower, a warm-up area, and plenty of seating for parents, friends, and guests.

We owe this expansion in part to our amazing students who uphold the standards of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and the vision of academy owner Professor Matt Vernon, who sought to cultivate an environment where students would feel welcomed, safe, encouraged, and enjoy an ever-evolving curriculum of top notch martial arts instruction.

In addition to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, we also offer Muay Thai and Judo classes for adults 13 and up, and BJJ for kids ages 5-12.

LITTLE PRIMATES

At Primate BJJ we are passionate about what we do. Our instructors are committed to ensuring our Kids Jiu Jitsu program provides a fun, safe, and encouraging environment for our young students to learn and grow. Kids classes at Primate Jiu Jitsu teach far more than just the most effective form of self defense. Jiu Jitsu is a social activity as much as it is an independent journey, which gives kids the opportunity to practice social skills and make healthy friends at the same time they build self confidence and self respect through personal achievements. One of the most precious benefits of children’s Jiu Jitsu is experiencing the true fulfillment of rewards that can only be earned with time, sweat, and met challenges. In a world dominated by instant gratification, the value of hard work is an easy lesson to miss as a child and gets harder to learn the older we become. Furthermore, Jiu Jitsu is a great opportunity for kids to get quality exercise and have a great time doing it! Sign your little ones up for a FREE CLASS or $20 TWO WEEK TRIAL and see for yourself why the kids (and parents) love coming to Primate Jiu Jitsu!
TINY KIDS (AGES 5-7)

Our Tiny Kids program is designed for the smallest of our youngsters. Class begins with a traditional line-up, fun warm-ups, and basic movement drills. The instructors will demonstrate a fundamental Brazilian Jiu Jitsu technique and students will pair off to drill it on a coach or on each other under instructor supervision. Towards the end of class, students will participate in supervised “situational rolling.” This is a safe, supervised way for our smallest students to practice their BJJ fundamentals against fully resisting opponents starting from familiar positions. Time permitting, we will end class with a fun group activity such as dodgeball.
BIG KIDS (AGES 8-12)

Once kids reach the ripe old age of 8, we invite them to attend our Big Kids program. These classes follow a similar format to the Tiny Kids classes, but the technical drills will be more complex and include additional details. Furthermore, Big Kids will also participate in “free rolling.” While a situation roll begins from a familiar position (such as the closed guard or side control), free rolling is an open format roll where students begin from a neutral, standing position.";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay Thai ";"http://www.primatebjj.com/schedule-rates/";"http://www.primatebjj.com/schedule-rates/";"Monday: 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM

Combined with the silent knowledge of their ability to defend themselves, our student leave with life-changing confidence that lasts!
The Real Deal

NMA has a Mixed Martial Arts approach to teaching children with a curriculum including Krav Maga, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and Kickboxing. All of which are practical, real-life systems of self-defense—not sport Martial Arts that have scoring zones, referees, time limits, weight classes, etc; which are highly unrealistic in preparing for an actual “street” confrontation. This no-nonsense approach gives National Martial Arts students an edge.
Is YOUR Child ready?

At National Martial Arts, we never just throw children into a class; we do at least one private evaluation lesson with them first. This gives us the opportunity to see which one of our programs will work best for each child as an individual.
Introductory lessons are also a great opportunity for you, the parent(s), to see our state-of-the-art facility, meet our instructors, and see firsthand what we teach and how we teach it. So give us a call today to schedule a private lesson to see if NMA is a good fit for your family. It is totally free and there is no obligation to continue. We hope to see you soon! 405-692-7300

KIDS & ADULT BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU
Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, or BJJ, is a martial art & combat sport that focuses on using the principles of leverage to defeat your opponent by gaining a dominant position over them & applying a submission hold (usually chokes or joint locks). Modern Brazilian Jiu-jitsu traces its roots to the older Japanese art Jujitsu, which was later refined in Japan for more sporting purposes & renamed Judo. Judo & BJJ have many techniques in common; however, Judo emphasizes primarily throwing techniques, while BJJ focuses more on finishing the fight on the ground. Modern BJJ encompasses almost all grappling arts; including wrestling.  “Jiu-jitsu” translates as “gentle art” and it focuses on using leverage and technique redirect your opponent’s strength and to maximize your own strength in the most efficient manner possible. For this reason, the techniques of BJJ have been proven to be very effective for smaller, weaker people, even against a much larger, more athletic opponent.

In BJJ, there are no static “forms” or moves that are “too lethal” to practice in any type of realistic context. Because it is a grappling art, practitioners can safely spar with at full speed with live resistance, while minimizing the chance for serious injury- making it the most effective, “battle-tested” art in the world. BJJ is one of the very few Martial Arts in the world that gives students the ability to test the effectiveness of their techniques in a live setting; which is a huge gift and an even bigger responsibility. Live sparring and drilling is an extremely important component of training in BJJ, and a student’s ability to apply their techniques in a realistic situation with a resisting opponent also plays a major role in rank advancement in the art. BJJ is traditionally practiced in the gi, or kimono, a uniform consisting of loose fitting pants and a jacket, which enables the practitioner to use the grips on the cloth to hold, throw, and submit their opponent. However, techniques for training without the kimono (or “no-gi”) are also taught. Brazilian Jiu-jitsu may be used for self-defense, sport-grappling tournaments, and mixed martial arts (MMA).

The effectiveness of BJJ is unquestionable, and has been proven over the years so much so that it is now a staple of virtually every professional fighter’s arsenal. Whether you are young or old, looking for a healthy hobby, a system of self-defense, or wanting to become a serious competitor or professional fighter, the practice of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu will give you a lifetime of benefits, if one is willing to put in the time & dedication to become a serious student.

Give us a call today to schedule a free introductory class to see if Jiu Jitsu is the art for you!

This helps you raise a child with great personality, commitment and work ethic, in short, a well-adjusted youth that will make for a fine adult.

Prepare your child for bullies...

According to the National Education Association, 160,000 kids miss school every day out of fear of bullies.

in 2002, the U.S. Secret Service concluded that bullying played a significant role in the majority of school shootings.

Studies show that adults who were bullied as children have higher levels of depression and lower self-esteemthan those who weren't.

...Prepare your child for life!!!


With our bully proof curriculum we instill confidence by teaching your child how to protect themselves from over aggressive kids.  We reinforce discipline by rewarding hard work with belt promotions.  Each promotion will reinforce your child's commitment to achieving meaningful results through hard work and discipline - characteristics that will serve them in all areas of life!  Our program will also show that fitness can be fun.  Most kids do not like formal exercise, but they do like to play.  We carefully combined physical activity with exciting mental stimulation to keep kids focused throughout the lessons.  They have fun and get in shape at the same time.";"http://www.tritonfightcenter.com/schedule-programs/#/womens-jiujitsu/";"Sunday - 12noon to 1pm

Teaching is more than a passion for him. He knows firsthand that the values and principles, taught through the martial arts, are life changing. Mr. Epps' purpose and mission for Pride Mixed Martial Arts is to educate, edify, and empower students to live life without limits or compromise.

“This letter is to commend Levi Mason for something he did yesterday on our school playground at recess. There was a boy student who was out of control with anger and who was a danger to the other students and the adults on the playground. I was trying to restrain him and diffuse the situation with another woman helping. All of a sudden, Levi was there, asking if I needed help. I said yes and Levi moved in front of the boy, holding his chest at arm’s length. The boy was raging and trying to hurt whoever was in his way. Levi began talking very calmly and telling the student to breathe, slow down, relax, etc., all the while keeping him respectfully restrained. He acted in an incredibly courageous manner, putting himself in harm’s way to protect me and the other students, and at the same time trying to help the boy. I consider him a hero in the situation and highly commend him for his courage and bravery.

Five Ring Jiu Jitsu is proud to offer the Skillz Dynamic Martial Arts Training for Kids that teach exciting and fun martial arts that help kids burn off extra energy and make friends for life.

Five Rings Jiu Jitsu's Skillz Martial Arts breaks the Kids classes into your child's ability so that each level can give your child exactly what they need. This makes each individual Kids Martial Arts class powerful, fun and exciting, because our Kids Martial Arts curriculum is infused with the latest understandings in child psychology and development. This makes our program more than just a martial arts program--it's a child development course.
Kids Martial Arts Classes In Portland Are The Perfect Activity For Your Child!

Our Skillz program teaches students confidence, self-esteem, goal-setting, how to be a leader, respect for teachers and parents, a greater appreciation for academics and the ability to deal with bullies and self-defense as a last resort. A great student at Five Rings Jiu Jitsu isn't only a great martial artist, but a great person as well.

    Early Skillz/Ninjas (3 & 4 years old)

3 to 4 year olds love physical activity and anything involving play. They have a rich imagination and strong desire to be less dependent on their usual caregivers. With that said, a structured program introducing early skill-based training in Martial Arts can prove to be very successful.

The problem is many children this age have a hard time with structure in a group environment like what is commonly found in most Martial Arts schools. With Five Rings Jiu Jitu's Skillz program, the solution is to provide them with their own program that targets their stage of development in a manner that keeps them entertained while at the same time building skills that set them up for the next age group.

    Basic Skillz/Samurai (5 & 6 year old)

5 and 6 year olds are the most enthusiastic students. They love creativity and problem solving, which makes them ideal students in the Martial Arts. The problem we discovered is they are so progressive in following tasks, some teachers tend to treat them like their older peers. This is a problem because they still do not have the basic skills necessary to keep up with children ages 7 and up.

We have found that providing them with their own program that targets their stage of development in a manner that adapts to their social and intellectual curiosity while at the same time building skills that set them up for success. With that said a structured program introducing basic skill-based training in Martial Arts has proven to be very successful.

    Core Skillz/Dragons (7 to 9 year olds)

Five Rings Jiu Jitsu's Core Skillz program for 7 to 9 year olds is what most people consider “the golden age.” They are proficient in their vocabulary and problem-solving skills, yet they are not at the age where they want complete independence from adults. This makes the teacher-student relationship stronger than ever. The problem we discovered is they still lack core skills, and although they are highly intelligent, they struggle to keep up with students ages 10 and up.

Our solution is to provide them with their own program that targets their stage of development in a manner that adapts to their adventurous attitude and youthful nature while at the same time building skills that set them up for success. With that said a structured program introducing core skill-based training in Martial Arts has proven to be very successful.

    Extreme Skillz/Warriors (10 to 13 year olds)

The Extreme Skillz at Five Rings Jiu Jitsu are the smartest students in the school. Yes, they are smarter than most adults! They are also physically competent and can excel in most physical challenges that are presented to them. The problem we discovered is they are so focused on what is socially acceptable that they have a hard time keeping themselves emotionally driven to the task at hand.

Five Rings Jiu Jitsu provides them with their own program that targets their stage of development in a manner that nurtures their social and emotional instability while at the same time building skills that set them up for success. With that said a structured program introducing extreme skill-based training in Martial Arts has proven to be very successful.

    Elite Skillz/Shinsengumi (14 to 16 year olds)

If your child is consistent in attendance, demonstrates proper behavior, puts forth great effort in class, he or she may be ready four our Elite Skillz program. The physical skills and attributes your child will develop in the Elite Skillz program at Five Rings Jiu Jitsu will continually improve as this program continues development to build success in all areas of life.

Our Elite Skillz program places focus on leadership, which is key to success in any profession. The purpose of this pgoram is to help mold your child into the best leader possible by utilizing a variety of tools & resources. Through our program, your child will enjoy innovative and fun training where they will both learn and apply essential leadership skills, including: social interaction, emotional intelligence, transformational vocabulary, and more!

We Develop Life Champions. Will Your Child Be Next?
Hello! I’m Professor Omar Santiago, head instructor at Mata-Leao Combat Sports (MLCS).

I would like to personally thank you for visiting our website. If you are here, it means you are looking for an opportunity to give your child “something more.” That’s why I’m so excited to invite you to join one of our FREE classes today.

As a father myself, I am truly passionate about martial arts and its power to help kids grow as individuals into strong, self-disciplined and confident young leaders.

I am also passionate about child safety, and making sure that I equip kids with the personal resources they need to deal with social challenges such as peer pressure and bullying – and to make good choices when confronted with such challenges.

Of all the programs we offer at the Mata-Leao Combat Sports, our Youth Enrichment Program (a.k.a. our ""kids program"") is the most important. As a parent, I’m sure you would understand and agree.

I’ve been fortunate to work with many kids from all walks of life. I know firsthand about all the unhealthy distractions that kids face these days, in and out of school:

    Drugs and alcohol
    Peer pressure and bullying
    Gangs and predators 

    Violent video games and
    unhealthy activities
    Other self-destructive behaviors

Thankfully, I know how the martial arts can keep a child on the right track. It gives kids the skills needed to make informed decisions, smart choices and healthy options.

With martial arts, your child can have that extra “something” they need to thrive and succeed, physically, emotionally and mentally. That’s my promise to you.

""Oliver started jiu jitsu about a year ago and has really enjoyed the program, he has enjoyed how many chances he gets to work with different people which I think is always a great thing to have with any sport.He has grown tremendously in his ability to stay focused and is becoming more organized, which I feel is because of it and am really happy that he has joined this program and I look forward to many more accomplishments from him.""

How Do Your Kids Spend Their Free Time?
 Better Than Team Sports...

As a parent today, you often have to compete with TV, video games, YouTube videos, Hanna Montana, fast food restaurants and many other non-constructive distractions, for your child’s attention.

Ultimately, many parents seek out sports as an outlet to help their children acquire some of the skills that are needed to fortify their child’s success.

But, did you know that kids martial arts is 10 times better than team sports in developing your child’s self esteem and confidence? Recent studies show that programs that focus on personal achievement are vastly more effective than team sports.

Of course, scholastic team sports do have many benefits to your child’s development. However, research is proving they may not teach many of the important skills that will help your child gain the confidence and self esteem needed to not only overcome many of today’s real life situations, but also thrive and succeed.

Because it’s not seasonal, like many team sports, our Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program will arm your child with a host of positive mental and physical skills that will help him or her in school, at home and in life – all year long.

Don't Allow Your Child to Become Another Bullying Statistic
It’s a sad fact: Bullies are an everyday reality. Statistics show that almost every child in the country will confront many bullies during their younger years.

Ultimately, when it comes to BULLIES, our main focus is personal protection and self defense.

Our goal is to keep bullies in check in our community by developing unshakeable confidence in your children and – if self defense is necessary – by equipping your kids with the competition-winning martial arts moves they need to protect themselves.

We teach Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or ""the gentle art,"" that allows smaller, possibly weaker individuals to successfully defend themselves against bigger, stronger aggressor. By simply using leverage and proper technique, we will teach your child how to defend him or herself without causing harm to themselves or their attacker.

life-threatening predator or situation that your child could face in the future. We can never tell what the future holds, but we can equip our kids with the right tools to face any situation.

We don't give children a false sense of reality by teaching them how to be victorious only in competition. Our program teaches your child how to protect him or herself in real life-threatening situations.

Call today (503-208-3160) to set up your 30-day FREE trial today AND you'll also recieve our special video series BULLY BUSTERS - 5 Simple Jiu Jitsu Techniques for Kids.

We've been coming to the studio here for about 4 or 5 months now. Chase really looks forward to coming every week. What I enjoy is the one on one teaching and coaching that he gets in regards to Brazilian Jiu jitsu and its certainly is building his self esteem making him more confident and he really looks forward in coming down here sparring with his partners, getting the one on one instruction that is really developing the skills in these areas.We are very thankful for that they're doing a great job here. I would recommend it to any one.""

Nemesis – We All Have One

At Nemesis Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, it’s all about conquering the personal nemeses in our lives. Everyone shows up here for a different reason. People from various walks of life show up to learn self-defense, get in shape, manage stress, push themselves to the limit, improve their athletic game, improve their grappling, or overcome other personal barriers. What everyone leaves with is friendship, confidence, passion, and an art that they can share with their children, siblings, and best friends.
New to Jiu-Jitsu?

Our Introduction to Jiu-Jitsu course is designed for the student who has little or no previous knowledge of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The course covers the fundamentals of sport and self-defense jiu-jitsu and repeats every 2 months. Students are encouraged to continue attending the beginners course until they feel comfortable – many of our advance (2+ years) students still attend the beginners classes to hone their fundamental skills. 

The Eric Hemphill Style

I believe jiu-jitsu as a whole is all about timing, rhythm, and motion. Because of this I do not focus solely on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, but jiu-jitsu as a whole. Jiu-jitsu as an art is much broader and accepting of other forms of grappling.  Jiu-jitsu should not shut out the rest of the grappling world.  It is my belief that Jiu-jitsu should accept what is good and what is pure from all the diverse grappling disciplines.  I trained in an area where a lot of Greco-Roman wrestling, freestyle wrestling, western wrestling, boxing, and American kickboxing was taught simultaneously.   All of these disciplines have influenced my style of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. They are the foundation of my game and the game of my students.  It is through this foundation that I teach a jiu-jitsu based on sensibility, physical fitness, and passion.

I want people to have fun pushing themselves and improving their life, by learning to defend themselves. I want to help build self-confidence in my students and share with them an art that they can pass down to their children. Camaraderie is a big part of Nemesis. Students of all levels interact and build each other up on and off the mat. There is a sense of encouragement and accountability here. People at all stages of their game encourage one another to perfect a new move, practice better technique, or simply show up on a regular basis. This accountability helps to build confidence, individual game, and strong relationships in and out of the gym.

The one secret in life is to find that one thing that makes you happy and never stop doing it. I want to do this forever – until I die.";"http://www.nemesisbjj.com/wp-content/themes/Nemesis/images/nemesis.png";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"http://www.nemesisbjj.com/index.html?p=9";"Monday: 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM, 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM

Joining the Marine Corps shortly afterwards, he became a weapons instructor for his battalion teaching knife techniques to over 1000+ people.

Serving for four years, he spent another four at Portland State University earning two Bachelor’s Degrees in business. He used his experience with martial arts and teaching to help pay for his school and living expenses by teaching martial arts on the side, and continued to train with several instructors to further increase his knowledge in the arts.

Professor Jeff opened up Northwest Fighting Arts in 1994 with long-time friend and training partner Sean Haley, who later left to pursue a fight career.  After several years and a few location changes, Northwest Fighting Arts has become one of the largest and most successful schools in the Portland area. There are 500 active students under his guidance and instruction today.

Professor Jeff teaches a variety of classes along with his senior students at Northwest Fighting Arts, and has used his knowledge and skills he’s learned from his instructors to build a highly detailed and in-depth curricula for each respective art.

These Martial Arts include Muay Thai, Western Boxing, Jeet Kune Do, several Filipino Arts which include Kali/Eskrima/Arnis for weapons training and Panantukan/Dumog/Sikaran for empty-hand training. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for the ground-game, several empty-hand Tai Chi forms which include the Yang and Chen family-styles, Yichuan, Hsing-I, Baqua, Qigong and many Tai Chi weapon forms like the Sword, Fan, Saber, Long-Staff and Short-Staff.

With over 27 years of experience, Professor Jeff has accumulated enough knowledge to bring a beginner in any of the arts to a full-fledged instructor.

Professor Jeff’s extensive training and expertise in Muay Thai comes from Ajarn Chai Sirisute. Back in 1968 Ajarn Chai brought Muay Thai to the United States, and took an American team back to Thailand to compete and win the Thai Championship in 1982. This was the first time the Thai’s have lost to a foreign country in their own sport. Ajarn Chai has popularized Muay Thai over the years and hosts seminars around the world, teaching tradition and training methods to thousands of people. He has been Professor Jeff Patterson’s personal Muay Thai instructor for over 25 years.

Professor/Sifu Jeff has also trained and honed his skills in Western Boxing, several Filipino Arts and Tai Chi concepts under his long-time teacher and mentor, Punong Guro Leonard Trigg. Punong Guro Leonard Trigg has successfully trained and brought 9 champion fighters for the Olympics in Western Boxing. Under his guidance, Professor Jeff has sparred and trained with several of those athletes and had the opportunity to work with Clayton Hires, who was a sparring partner for the famous Marvin Hagler and now boxing coach to MMA fighters such as Chael Sonnen and Uriah Hall.

Along with Western Boxing, Professor Jeff has trained in many Filipino Arts and Jeet Kune Do concepts under Punong Guro Leonard Trigg, as well as Guro Dan Inosanto, the late Punong Guro Edgar Sulite and the late Guro Ted LucayLucay. This training has given Professor Jeff 25+ years of training by many sought-out masters of the Filipino Arts/JKD and propelled his skills to an extremely high level.

Surrounded by a wrestling community while growing up, he always had a strong desire to learn more about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Being a 2nd degree Black Belt, Professor Jeff has trained with many masters of the art and has been around the game since 1992. Master Rigan Machado has been his personal and long-time instructor since 1998 and awarded Professor Jeff his Black Belt in 2008. Other influences and instructors Professor Jeff had the opportunity to train with include Pedro Sauer, Rickson Gracie, Anibol Lobo and Fabio Santos.

Under the wing of many Tai Chi masters, Sifu Jeff has trained with Sifu Leonard Trigg, Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming, Sifu Gregory Fong, and Sifu Thomas Flannel. His biggest influence in Tai Chi training is Grand Master Sam Tam. Under Grand Master Sam Tam’s guidance, Sifu Jeff has spent years perfecting and fine-tuning all of his Tai Chi forms which range from empty-hand styles like the Chen style to weapon styles like the Tai Chi Sabre. Sifu Jeff has trained with Grand Master Sam Tam since 2004.

In his 8,200 square foot academy in Portland, Sifu Jeff has taken many students from beginners to instructors using his teaching methods and skills he has learned over the years, and continues to share his passion for the arts to new and experienced students alike. As I write this I look back at all of the training I have done here with Sifu Jeff I have been under his tutelage for over 13 years and continue to be amazed at the depth of the program here. I have seen Sifu bring students up from beginner stages to opening up and running schools of their own.

Sifu Jeff has trained fighters in Western boxing, Muay Thai, MMA and Jiu jitsu. He has trained students who have gone on to fight in the UFC, who have achieved numerous titles and successful fight careers.

All of these accomplishments aside one of the things I find most valuable about the program and organization Sifu has created is the culture and community of our academy. Everyone is focused, humility is the norm and the light hearted friendly nature of the staff  he has placed around him is awesome. If you get the opportunity you will be lucky to have experienced martial arts in this incredible environment that Sifu has created.";"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/3442764139/16f16fa4fb366c67b48b600011cd24ad_400x400.jpeg";"http://nwfighting.com/kids-martial-arts/";"Discipline, Focus, Confidence and Strength… Learn How Kids Martial Arts Can Teach Your Child These Skills…

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and ground fighting with the goal of gaining a dominant position and using joint-locks and chokeholds to force an opponent to submit.

It promotes the principle that a smaller, weaker person using leverage and proper technique can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger assailant. BJJ can be trained for its health benefits, self-defense, and sport grappling tournaments.

Our Philosophy

We train by the Judo principle of “Mutual respect and benefit”, so although we love to compete; self-discipline and respect for each other always come first. Some of the best memories of practicing at PDXBJJ were made before and after class sitting around on the mat hanging out with new friends. We enjoy training and learning from everyone.

We believe that with a commitment to Jiu Jitsu, the quality of our lives can be transformed on and off the mat. Whether it be for competition, self-defense or as a workout, your instructors and teammates here at PDXBJJ will help you achieve the goals you set for yourself.

Provide structure for your child by adding Judo into their routine. Judo differs from many other martial arts because children must work with each other. In Judo your child will learn about cooperation and teamwork while making new friends. It also teaches sportsmanship through fun and friendly competition.

Judo teaches children discipline by requiring them to always respect their instructors, teammates and training area. This code of conduct inevitably transfers to their home, school and friends.

We offer a safe, clean and nurturing environment. The American College of Sports Medicine has noted that Judo is the safest contact sport for children under 13.

Many parents place their kids in martial arts with the hopes that it will teach them respect and discipline, others out of concern that their child is being bullied – or even that their child is the bully, and still others because they have fond memories of their own martial arts classes as children. Whatever your reason for looking into Brazilian jiu jitsu for your child, know that we understand that choosing where to go can be an intimidating task.

Our kids program is without peer in Portland. Here at RGAPDX, we know that it is important to train and learn to use your body in a way that not only promotes growth but is also sustainable – which is to say that safety is of utmost importance to us. We take great pride in teaching things like learning to fall without injury and to treat your training partner with respect, how to use leverage to escape from an opponent and defend yourself without punching and kicking, all while having an awesome time.

Our team is always looking for new training partners and we have some of the friendliest, respectful, and fiercest girls and boys around.

KIDS BRAZILIAN JIU-JITSU
Age 5-7 and 8+

The Renzo Gracie Kids Program is designed to provide a safe environment for children to learn how to defend themselves while having fun. The program itself helps to develop confidence, self-respect, and responsibility. Our program achieves this by focusing on the concepts of mutual welfare and respect.

In addition to self-defense techniques, the Kids program also focuses heavily on skill building drills to develop body awareness, strength, agility, and flexibility. All techniques are taught with a safety first mentality which allows students to develop the confidence to apply the techniques on resisting partners without sacrificing effectiveness.


3 – 4 Year Old Tumbling Class

Registration for this class is limited to 10 students per class.

Three and four year old’s meet once a week, Saturday morning for a ”tumbling” or “dynamic movements” class. Through games and exploration, students will learn forward and backward rolls, falls, back bends and the basics of more dynamic movements such as cartwheels and handstands. The aim is to both prepare their bodies for jiu jitsu/wrestling and to get the younger kids a little more experience listening, paying attention, and following directions while being in a class with others. Lots of games, lots of fun.

KIDS COACHES

Renzo Gracie Portand sets the standard for martial arts instruction in Portland. Most notably, our kids classes are taught by seasoned instructors with years of experience working with children. You can be sure that what your child learns in class is exciting and challenging. The material taught to our students is never watered down, so you can be sure that in addition to having fun your child will be learning applicable skills and technique.

We provide unprecedented personal attention to the individual student. On a normal day, our student to teacher ratio in the kids classes is less than 10:1 and we almost always have teaching assistants on the mat. Moreover, you can expect that Renzo Gracie Academy coaches are open to discussing your son or daughter’s progress on the mats should the interest arise.

KIDS BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU

The kids Jiu Jitsu classes at Team Quest in Portland are structured to allow kids of all experience and skill levels to learn the martial art of BJJ (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). Separated by age and size in the class allows the kids to train with other children who can help push them to succeed as well as learn how to defend themselves from opponents with the use of the gi. The kids Jiu Jitsu classes require a gi (kimono) to ensure the use of proper technique and give your child a realistic feel of wrestling in real life situations as we typically wear clothing while in self defense situations.
BENEFITS OF BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU:

    Learn to defend yourself on the ground as well as in close range
    Train in a “must-know” style for any professional mixed martial artists like the guys fighting in the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship)
    Get in shape and participate in a life-long activity that everyone from children to senior citizens can do
    Master chokes, armlocks, and other submission holds that allow you to end a confrontation with no punches or kicks necessary
    Have fun while mastering the martial art commonly referred to as ‘human chess’

WHAT IS BRAZILIAN JIU-JITSU?

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a complete fighting system that teaches you how to control and subdue your opponent. You learn not only how to immobilize an opponent effectively so they can’t attack you, but also how to defeat them humanely without having to seriously hurt them. It’s the only proven style where a smaller person can immobilize and defeat a stronger, larger attacker.

It is so effective in fact, it is considered to be required training for anyone who chooses to compete in the world renowned Ultimate Fighting Championships. Every single UFC Champion trains in Jiu-Jitsu or grappling. Bottom line, what you are going to learn in our Jiu-Jitsu classes works because its what professional fighters rely on when they step into the cage.";"N/A";"N/A";"MMA, Kickboxing, Boxing";"http://teamquestmma.net/prices/";"http://teamquestmma.net/schedule/";"Monday: 9:00 AM - 8:00 PM

...While Making Sure They Have a TON of Fun

Martial arts classes normally makes you think of self-defense, being strong, fit and safe. The truth is, it’s all that and WAY more!


A Few Words
From John Geyston

I’m John Geyston, Owner / Chief Instructor here at John Geyston's Martial Arts.

As a martial arts instructor with extensive experience training kids, there is nothing better than seeing them grow firsthand.

But more important than the martial arts skills they learn… is the personal skills they develop and carry for life.

Because martial arts is so much more than just kicking and punching, and getting the next colorful belt.

It’s about developing confidence, discipline, character, focus and respect.

With every class we teach, your kids are growing in mind, body and character.

That’s because martial arts provides instant positive feedback. Through learning to focus on the core moves, they develop discipline and respect. They can instantly see and feel a difference, making them destined to build confidence, self-awareness and self-respect.

And of course it’s a ton of FUN!

That’s why I love teaching martial arts to kids in this community, and why I know your kids are going to LOVE training.

So please have a look below to find out exactly how your kids can benefit from our fun martial arts classes.

Thanks!

Childhood attitudes toward fitness take root early

The lessons your child learns now about physical fitness may very well follow them into adulthood.

Martial arts instruction teaches kids about their bodies. They learn to push themselves and pursue fitness goals.

Studying martial arts sets kids up for good health and a healthy body image that they’ll keep throughout their lives.

Obesity leads to health problems and low self-esteem

Martial arts Instruction provides two essential elements for weight loss: cardiovascular activity and core and muscle toning.

We work with kids who need to lose weight by providing them with achievable goals.

Our focus on self-discipline helps kids understand that what they do affects their bodies, and helps them to lose weight and get in shape.

My name is Jeff Cvitak, head instructor of Martial Arts USA. I wanted to take a second to tell you a bit about our school, and what you can expect when you walk through our doors for the first time.

But just to warn you - when you come, prepare to be hooked. People fall in love with our programs from day 1, and I'm sure you will too. Here's a bit about why that happens...

Dedication.
Our expert martial arts staff is extremely, extremely, extremely dedicated to giving you the best possible experience you could ask for. They're there for every question you need answered... every boost of motivation when challenges arise... and to instill in you the wisdom that's been passed down through martial arts for thousands of years.

Our instructors care. They're here for you 110%.

 It's more than kicks and punches.
On the surface, our Springfield martial arts program might seem like learning how to defend yourself and your loved ones. In truth, martial arts is so much more. Through the effort, dedication, and practice you put into every class...

... every area of your life will see improvement. You'll gain focus, determination and confidence that will seep into everything you do. Whether it's at work, at home, or anywhere else - you'll be changed for life.

Martial arts is just as much about work on who we are inside as it is about the individual techniques and skills. With our program, you'll reap the full benefit of this ancient wisdom.

Fun.
And last but not least, we know how to have fun! After all, too much work is simply off-putting. When an activity is all serious focus and hard work, it's easy to burn out.

Every class is filled with smiles and laughter. You'll make friends, enjoy your time, and walk away happier than when you came.

Anyways, I hope to see you soon. Feel free to explore our site, and learn more about each of our Springfield martial arts programs. Then, call us when you're ready to get started.

But don't wait too long! Our classes are limited in size, and I'd hate to see you miss out.

To your success,

Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)

SFC Kids BJJ classes are open to members age 5 to 15. The Kids BJJ program at SFC Mixed Martial Arts teaches the full range of grappling skills and techniques that the adult classes teach, but at a pace and time frame more appropriate for younger members. Classes are one hour in duration, and typically include callisthenic warmups; takedown and grappling drilling; and sparring, or ""rolling."" Occasionally, the class will play fun grappling-skill games in lieu of sparring. Kids Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art based on grappling and ground fighting techniques. Children will learn how to control and subdue a larger and stronger opponent through the use of superior techniques, leverage, and body mechanics. With an emphasis on grappling rather than striking, children are able to practice with varying levels of intensity, without the threat of serious injuries which can occur more often in martial arts focused on punching and kicking. Children will gain strength, endurance, dexterity, control, balance, discipline, situational awareness and self-respect through the training, and they will have fun and make friends while learning the most effective form of self-defense. The Kids BJJ student practices in both in the gi and no-gi (t-shirts and shorts.)

Kids need help growing up. They need adults to come alongside them and provide inspiration.

Coach Smith knows all about it. He spent most of his childhood in the foster care system. It was tough.

There’s More Than Fighting to the Martial Arts

Coach Smith teaches self-control, self-discipline, integrity, the value of hard work… and more.

Get your children going in our Kids MMA classes. Our starter package provides an SMA authentic tee shirt, a 30-minute private lesson with Coach Smith, and a full month of unlimited classes.

Rather, it was a family and community centered environment that led to personal growth and development, and led to social and environmental responsibility.  In 2009, Aim High shifted its business classification to that of a non-profit organization with a focus on developing its students and community through education and acts of service.

Our growth didn't stop in 2009. Aim High has continued to improve and has solidified its identity as the premier martial arts school in Portland. In addition, our non-profit status has enabled Aim High to create a significant impact in our community. Since 2013, Aim High has given over $500,000 in scholarship funds to our students. In addition, folks from our community have graciously donated over 25,000 hours of volunteer time at Aim High.

Does Your 3-4 Year Old Struggle with Self-Control?
The Early SKILLZ program can help them learn appropriate behavior in a fun setting.

Three and four-year-old children are naturally curious. They’re restless and eager to explore their surroundings – and to test boundaries and establish their identities. They might not be ready for the rigid structure of a traditional martial arts class, but they do need to start learning about appropriate behavior.

A Few Words
From Master Jim O'Brien

I’m Master Jim O'Brien, Chief Instructor here at Murrayhill Martial Arts.

As a martial arts instructor with extensive experience training kids, there is nothing better than seeing them grow firsthand.

But more important than the martial arts skills they learn… is the personal skills they develop and carry for life.

Because martial arts is so much more than just kicking and punching, and getting the next colorful belt.

It’s about developing confidence, discipline, character, focus and respect.

With every class we teach, your kids are growing in mind, body and character.

That’s because martial arts provides instant positive feedback. Through learning to focus on the core moves, they develop discipline and respect. They can instantly see and feel a difference, making them destined to build confidence, self-awareness and self-respect.

And of course it’s a ton of FUN!

That’s why I love teaching martial arts to kids in this community, and why I know your kids are going to LOVE training.

So please have a look below to find out exactly how your kids can benefit from our fun martial arts classes.

Thanks!

Does your 3-4 year old
struggle with these things?

They are shy and may have difficulty approaching other kids – or sharing in a play situation.

They don’t pay attention to their surroundings and may end up being unintentionally destructive as a result.

They lack control and can’t stay in one place long enough to eat a meal or watch a movie.

Parenting can feel like running a marathon
Luckily there is a comprehensive solution…

It’s exhausting, and it’s not uncommon for parents to feel frustrated as they try to get their young children to behave, sit still, and be aware of what’s going on around them. Getting them to participate in any group activity can be difficult at best, particularly when the activity doesn’t take their natural inclinations and developmental needs.

The key to helping kids at this age gain control is to teach them basic skills while entertaining them. With calm and steady guidance, they can learn to understand basic martial arts skills – and acceptable martial arts school behavior – and have fun, too!

your child will grow with every class!

Early SKILLZ gives young children the basic skills and discipline they need to succeed. While they learn simple martial arts moves such as kicking, punching, blocking, crawling, and jumping, they also grasp valuable lessons about social conduct. Over time, Early SKILLZ students learn how to control their movements, follow directions, and interact with students and teachers.

Martial arts builds coordination and control

Students learn to be aware of themselves, others, and their surroundings, and to control their movements accordingly.

By learning basic martial arts moves, they build muscle coordination and become increasingly aware of spatial awareness.

focus and attention skills

Kids learn how to pay attention to verbal commands when they are given, and to avoid tuning out when something seems complicated.

By learning how to focus and ignore distractions, kids learn how to follow verbal instructions – and to remember them without needing reminders.

Martial arts training encourages perseverance

Kids learn how to manage anxiety and negative feelings, and not to give up when they are frustrated or upset.

Early SKILLZ includes training to help kids learn the value of persistence as they pursue achievable goals in a supportive setting.

Respect is the cornerstone of martial arts training

Early SKILLZ classes underscore the importance of self-respect and respect for others in social and classroom settings.

In our martial arts school, kids learn that all classmates are to be treated with respect, and be supportive and encouraging as their classmates pursue their goals.";"N/A";"N/A";"Kickboxing";"N/A";"N/A";"Monday: 8:30 AM - 2:30 PM, 3:30 PM - 9:00 PM

Our only competition is with ourselves - to be a better person today than we were yesterday. The challenge is to bring the mind, body, and spirit together as one and in harmony with all things, with nature and the universe.

There are no forms in Tien Tae Jitsu. We work on technique and set short-term and long-term goals; the achievement of these goals and the work we do to attain them fills us with purpose and pride. Our goal is to become more today than we were yesterday and to challenge ourselves again tomorrow.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu builds a character not just in adults but in kids specifically. Kids through our coaching learn valuable life lessons and martial arts skills that will help them in their youth life, as well as concur any obstacles in the future. 

We believe that BJJ is a fun and as such is being taught to the kids. First we teach kids respect for their partners and coaches, their parents and teachers. We strive to instill sense of responsibility and accountability in them so they become great people with exceptional characters.

We help them realize how BJJ and other martial arts can help them in dealing with every day life, and we do our best to help them bridge any gaps that they believe they have in their skills, abilities, and motivation.

All of our KIDS BJJ classes are gender neutral. This means that your child will get a chance to ""role"" with different type of partners (heavy, light, strong, less strong, fast, slow, beginner, advanced, expert, younger, older, etc etc etc). There is no better way to become good at BJJ than to role as much as you can with various type of BJJ partners. What you will find amazing is that your partner will tell you if they notice you doing something not as efficient and they will help you reach the Next Level in your game. This is especially true for kids. That is what family does; helps every member to be at their best! If you think we repeat here what we said for Adults BJJ you are right! Beauty of BJJ is that is age and gender neutral. What we teach in adult classes we teach in kids classes. No exceptions!



What is your Excuse?

 

""Jiu jitsu definitely has its challenges. For me personally it has been a very challenging martial art for me to become proficient in. I can only imagine how challenging BJJ would be for a youngster with Autism. The young man rolling with me in the photo is Gunnar. He deals with Autism. He trains BJJ. What's your excuse ? :)""

Greg Thompson, Next Level MMA Owner";"http://nextlevelmma.com/";"Women BJJ

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu stems from the need for lighter fighter to win against bigger and stronger opponent. If you are looking for a way to be able to defend yourself and to be able to neutralize someone's attack (read: neutralize your attacker where attacker begs for forgiveness) look no more: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is for you.

Once you submit someone who is 60 + lbs heavier than you feeling of power, confidence, reward will overwhelm you. At that moment you will realize why Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is called an Art.

You’ve come to the right place! We are the premiere Martial Arts school in the Portland area, serving Tualatin, Lake Oswego, Tigard and our surrounding neighbors. Are you ready to embark on a journey full of dynamic experiences, new adventures, incredible workouts and most importantly the education you deserve? Read on below to find out more about our school or click the links in the navigation bar to the left to head straight to the class of your choice. 

The RCW Difference

We don’t simply offer the most well rounded curriculum of any martial arts school because it’s trendy. This is our passion and myself along with our entire staff of professors and coaches made it our mission to travel the world and source the very best up to date material around. Because of this you’ll find a higher degree of safety and community that most school’s can’t match. Classes for every skill level, with opportunities to better yourself every step of the way. Whether it’s working in class with partners, attending seminars with world class experts, or competition, you’ll find it at RCW. 

Which path will you choose? 

- Kali & JKD - Kali refers to the “bladed art” and features all manner of handheld weaponry. Under the Inosanto method students learn 12 key areas of blunt, sharp, and projectile tools. Dan Inosanto is our chief instructor who is the heir apparent to Jeet Kune Do, Bruce Lee’s art and philosophy. Tailored for MMA and street self defense, it has an unrivaled depth of efficacy that can’t be matched, it’s basically Krav Maga on steroids! 

- Gracie Jiu Jitsu - Pinoeered by Helio Gracie and made famous by his sons who conquered the world in both Vale Tudo (no rules) and the UFC. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has taken the world by storm. Because it uses principles of leverage and skeletal positioning it’s indispensable for anyone of any size, shape and age. It’s a great work out that teaches you how to neutralize any opponent on the ground. 

- Muay Thai - Known as the art of 8 limbs because of the use of knees and elbows, Muay Thai is more than a kickboxing sport. It’s the national past time of Thailand and rich in culture. It is also a military art and rapidly puts together devastating combinations from Boxing, Kickboxing, and clinch work. A Muay Thai class will get you in shape, fast! In a typical hour we usually burn 800-1000 calories.

We currently offer an amazing youth program for ages 5-12. Kids ages 13 and up are referred to our adult and teen programs. 

WHAT WE PROVIDE: 

An amazing Bully Proof Gracie Jiu Jitsu program. Your child will turn into a self-defense super star using our non-violent approach to confrontation. Jiu Jitsu literally means “the gentle art” and we’ve had tons of real world success stories where bigger kids were bullying our students and they put a stop to it. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) gives students a non-violent way to subdue a larger aggressor. It teaches them how to control a bully and in doing so they become a hero. Because our students first instinct is not to strike the bully, they often overcome hardships, make friends and are applauded by the school staff for safely defending themselves. It could also be potentially dangerous for a younger child to defend themselves by punching a bigger, older, bully. However, I can show you an 8 year old that can hold his own practicing BJJ with students 11 or 12 years old. This simply does not happen in typical martial arts, where self-defense takes a back seat to an athletic activity you can get anywhere. Our kids are in great shape, healthy, full of life and athletic AND they learn a valuable martial art in BJJ. 

Jump in right now, and we’ll give your family a FREE trial! 
Not only that, but kids in martial arts classes have better focus, listen at home and at a school and learn character building lessons not found anywhere else! Our Bully Proof BJJ program includes a rotational character development program that cycles four times per year to really season the lessons. We cover subjects like:

    Doing your best
    Good sportsmanship
    Honor
    Integrity 
    Perseverance
    And much more! 
Our staff and instructors live up to these examples and you can be sure your child will be training in a positive environment.
We’ve been around for nearly 10 years and have a reputation for only staffing qualified experienced instructors to lead our children’s class. In fact, in order to teach this program we require over 1,000 hours of training in addition to an instructor program before we’ll promote someone to teach these important classes.  

There’s nothing like BJJ classes for kids. Give your kids REAL martial art lessons that will last a life time. Give them the life skills and character development skills that will carry them through college and beyond!

It promotes confidence, discipline, respect, and many other developmental qualities.

Children are like sponges. When they are young and as they grow they absorb everything they see and listen to. It is important to surround them in a positive atmosphere so that they grow as an individual in a positive sense. Jiu-Jitsu allows them to do so. Not only does it teach them a form of self-defense, it also teaches many life lessons as well that a child can carry with them. Jiu-Jitsu is one of the most practical martial arts you can put your child in. When you think about other martial arts, many involve striking. Do you really want your child throwing up their fists? Today especially we see a lot of bullying in schools.  BJJ allows the child to work from the ground and gain control. We certainly do not want to encourage children to fight if they have the option to defend and find a way out of the situation.

As far as confidence goes, many children are shy or maybe not as social as others. Putting them in BJJ will allow that confidence to grow. Whether they are athletic or not, working with our children and receiving positive reinforcement will guarantee that their confidence will improve. Also, because of the practicality of the sport the confidence they gain will not be a false one. Many martial arts such as karate, incorporate flashy moves or board breaking. While these aspects may be fun, they are not going to carry over into real life scenarios, which In return could give your child a false sense of confidence.

Another huge benefit for kids in relation to BJJ is the physical benefits that come along with it. Today’s society is made up of video games and social media. Kids will spend hours on the couch or on their computers playing video games and being inactive. BJJ will teach your child how to live a healthy lifestyle which is so important to learn at a young age. We all know bad habits are hard to break once they’re established. Teaching them healthy habits at a young age will result in a manifestation of a positive life. They will burn calories, increase flexibility, improve balance and coordination and so much more.  Jiu-Jitsu teaches self-defense but also teaches you how to take care of your body.";"N/A";"N/A";"Muay Thai";"N/A";"http://www.lobojiujitsu.com/schedule/";"N/A";"Anibal Lobo";"1 free trial class offer!";"erik@lobojiujitsu.com";"https://web.facebook.com/loboJiuJitsu/";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Yes";

Bullying has become a prevalent problem in American Society. An American Justice Department school and cyber-bullying study shows that 1 out of every 4 kids will be bullied and that 150,000 kids miss school everyday in fear of bullying. (1)  According to one study, Pennsylvania is one of the five worst states to live in to avoiding bullying.  (2) Victims want to defend themselves, but most are too afraid for their personal safety and well being to do so
Statistics In America

    1 out of 4 kids is Bullied.
    150,000 kids miss school everyday in fear of bullying
    77% of students are bullied mentally, verbally, & physically.
    1 out of 5 kids admits to being a bully, or doing some “Bullying.”
    8% of students miss 1 day of class per month for fear of Bullies.
    43% fear harassment in the bathroom at school.
    282,000 students are physically attacked in secondary schools each month.

Owners were victims of bullies
Owners, Phil Migliarese, Ricardo Migliarese, and Frank Ambrifi are passionate about this subject for a reason. They were often the targets of bullying in school, in the street, and on the playground.

Once they started training with Relson Gracie, the bullying stopped instantly. The projection of being ready and willing to use GJJ, not the actual action of self defense, is what made the difference. Remembering the feeling of helplessness is what makes these instructors so motivated to help children.
We teach control, not violence

Other martial arts systems teach violence against violence. They teach a child to react with punches, kicks, knees, and elbows. The Bully Self Defense program starts by  teaching children how to verbally defuse a violent situation, to stop violence before it starts. However, if attacked, our students know Gracie Jiu Jitsu techniques that are defensive, use no striking, and can non-violently neutralize a bully. The confidence provided by the Bully Self Defense program teaches our students, as the Gracie’s say, “to fight fire with water – not fire.”
Our five objectives:

    Awareness and focus: Attacks can be physical, verbal or mental.  Our students recognize a bully’s behaviors and the best responses for each situation.
    Build Confidence: Our Gracie Jiu Jitsu classes teach techniques to negate a larger opponent while remaining calm. Bullies are less likely to harass children who display self-confidence.
    Making Education Fun: Students in our Bully Self Defense program have a great time while learning the best martial art in the world.
    Establish Readiness: Our program will help our students make it clear that bullying behavior is not acceptable, taking the power away from the bully.
    Balanced Lifestyle: Our students learn about a Balance diet, discipline and respect. This program is not one dimensional.  Our students don’t become better fighters, they become better people.

Bully Self Defense Programs:

Our Bully Self Defense programs are taught with energy, enthusiasm and excitement to promote learning while playing. Our students learn in a safe, violent free atmosphere without the stress of expectation. This makes learning fun for everyone involved and is what helps to make our program a success. The last and perhaps most important component is the support and encouragement of the parents. Our students – your children – cannot successfully build confidence without you believing in them and what they are learning. (Get started!)

LITTLE-JITSU tm (5-7 years old)

“Playing their way into Gracie JiuJitsu! It’s fun and it works!”

Young children do not want to learn, they want to play! We have secretly replaced their normal games with fun activities that teach basic self defense techniques and strong physical and mental reflexes. Through “playing” martial arts games, our LittleJitsu students are “tricked” into subconsciously learning and properly executing the foundations of Gracie Jiu Jitsu – control and leverage. Using energy, enthusiasm and excitement to promote learning while playing is a key to our LittleJitsu program. Once our students master the techniques of LittleJitsu, or once they turn 8 years old, they are promoted to our KidsJiu-Jitsu class.

KIDS JIU-JITSU (8-12 years old)

“Real Gracie Jiu-Jitsu broken down for kids!”

Jiu Jitsu literally translates to “the gentle art”.  As opposed to working against the force of an attack, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu manipulates the opponents energy, redirecting it into a counter maneuver. As bullying is rampant in the 8-14 age group, our Kids Jiu_Jitsu program is focused on the self defense techniques that are essential for a child to defend themselves with leverage if physically attacked by a bully. These techniques provide our students with the confidence and projection of being ready and willing to use the techniques that helped Phil and Rick change their own lives.

EasyEscape is an ongoing program that focuses on getting away from an attacker intelligently and with as little energy as possible. This program is a blend of strength training, yoga, Brazilian jiu-jitsu self defense, and striking. The focus is on escaping dangerous situations on the street. This is not a sport but a means of survival.

The following is  the history of our club as related by ""Professor Emeritus"" Art Borgeau in 2012.

The Philadelphia Judo Club is the oldest martial arts club in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1949, by Jack Feinsinger as The Philadelphia JuJitsu Club. The original location was the YMHA at Broad and Pine Streets. Being the first martial arts club in the city it enjoyed a certain amount of fame which included a television demonstration on the Today Show when Dave Garroway was the host. Traditional Japanese JuJitsu has no ranks so from an early point the club members would travel to New York to compete in Judo tournaments for rank advancement as students of Mr. Uchida’s Judo Club. Ultimately three of the original Philadelphia JuJitsu Club members went on to earn Black Belts in Judo.

They were Al Wallace, Helen Foos, and Jerry Goldman.

Of the three only Jerry Goldman is still alive. He is a 4th dan --Yodan, and because of his long history probably should be regarded as the Sempai (Senior) emeritus of the club. He is in his 80s, still single, lives in Cape May, and works summers as a blacksmith at Cold Springs Village. As a player he was famous for preferring ballet slippers to regular zori for the trip from the locker room to the mat. This caused the odd raised eyebrow or two, but no one ever challenged him on it. Blacksmiths are quite strong. Jerry was no exception. He once broke my nose during randori. Up to about his age 75, he and I would still occasionally visit the Cape May Coast Guard Gracie JuJitsu Club for a little Saturday afternoon fun and beat-up their players.

After a time Jack Feinsinger discovered he could not make a living teaching JuJitsu so he sold the club to another instructor whose name has been lost to posterity. It was a short-lived association.

The next instructor was Dr. I. Koiwai, a pathologist at Hahnemann Hospital and a 4th dan --Yodan in Judo. During his tenure the club became strictly Judo. The name was changed to The Philadelphia Judo Club, and the location was moved to the Chinatown YMCA. Not much is known about what happened during this period except that the three original Black Belts remained associated with it.

In the early 1960s a huge development happened. This part of the story has more than one version. Over the years I was told both versions. There is truth in each. Takahiko Ishikawa, former two-time All Japan Champion and Chief Instructor for the Tokyo Police Department had spent a period of self-imposed exile in Cuba from Japan. This was during the Batista years. When Fidel Castro came to power Ishikawa was forced to leave Cuba. Since a return to Japan was out of the question, the USA was his second choice. After World War II, he had been part of a tour of Japanese Martial Arts experts promoted by General Curtis LeMay of the US Air Force. Philadelphia was a stop on the tour. He liked the city. With General LeMay and Helen Foos helping he returned.

As a Hachidan (8th dan) he outranked Dr. Koiwai and instantly became the instructor for The Philadelphia Judo Club. There were ego problems between the two men. Ultimately the club split into two parts. The Philadelphia Judo Club moved to the YMCA at 15th and Arch Streets. For a time Dr. Koiwai remained the Chief Instructor there, then gradually ceded his duties to Jack Hunter, who ran things from the late 60s to the late 70s, when the club quietly drifted out of existence.

Our program works unlike any other children’s activity simply because it has the perfect blend of realistic training and fun learning.
 
Kid’s classes are taught by our expert instructors on an age appropriate level. We begin with self-discipline or what we like to call a non-quitting spirit. Self-discipline itself is not enough; we also teach our kids the art of self-defense, an important life skill. Kids today face more bullies and negative peer pressure than ever before, so it is essential they have the skills necessary to distinguish between good and bad, right from wrong.
 
At Semper Fi MMA Academy we teach a realistic, streetwise self-defense system that combines the most effective Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Wrestling, Judo, and Grappling techniques. So kids learn to defend themselves in virtually any situation, whether they are standing up in a conflict or end up on the ground. They also learn conflict resolution and when they should and shouldn’t use their new found skills.
 These are skills that can be used for a lifetime, such as:
 
                               The repetitive moves, details, rhythms, class rules and protocols that are emphasized during class all aid in the development of self-discipline.
 
                         The lessons regarding self-defense and restraint greatly aid in the development of confidence.
 
                  Martial art teaches children that staying fit can be done in an entertaining and fun manner. Stressing coordination and agility, martial arts is something that students benefit from for years. Also, martial arts are activities that can be practiced year round; it’s independent from the seasons and places in which we live.

The city, which is approximately halfway between the state's most populous city, Philadelphia, and the state capital, Harrisburg is strategically situated along a major transportation route from Central to Eastern Pennsylvania, and lent its name to the now-defunct Reading Railroad, which transported anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania Coal Region to the eastern United States via the Port of Philadelphia. Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic United States version of the Monopoly board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as ""The Pretzel City"", because of numerous local pretzel bakeries. Currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. According to the 2010 census, Reading has the highest share of citizens living in poverty in the nation. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists. With more than 125 miles of trails in five major preserves, it is an International Mountain Bicycling Association Ride Center and held the Reading Radsport Festival on September 8–9, 2017. In April 2017, it was announced that an indoor velodrome, or cycling track, will be built in Reading as the first of its kind on the East Coast and only the second in the entire country. Albright College and the World Cycling League formally announced plans April 6, 2017, to build the $20 million, 2,500-seat facility, which will be called the National Velodrome and Events Center at Albright College. It will also serve as the Cycling League's world headquarters.

Reading, PA, with surrounding areas in Exeter, Birdsboro, Douglassville, Muhlenberg, Reading and Shillington, is home to Next Level Martial Arts, a Muay Thai facility focusing on programs in Birthday Parties, Kids Martial Arts, Muay Thai, Summer Camp, and Hyper Fight Club.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is by far the best self-defense for children and teens. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu focuses on grappling and submission techniques. Students learn take-downs, falling, grips, controls, and submissions which are highly effective for neutralizing, controlling, and restraining opponents. Students learn the core techniques of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu through drilling and sparring. Because Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training doesn't involve any striking, students can spar live during every class, significantly acceralting their learning.

What Students should Expect on the First Day
New students are highly encouraged to jump right in on their first day. New students may attend the first two classes with our without their uniform. Some new students prefer to sit and watch the first class too, however students will get a much better sense of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu by joining in. Class starts with a 10-15 minute warm-up, followed by learning technique and drilling. Finally students spar live with each other to test out their skills and improve their stamina. Many new students are reluctant during and after the first class. However, it only takes a few classes for new students to learn the basic positions and techniques, and to find out how fun it is.

Discover How To Give Your Child A Head Start In Life

Are you doing everything you can to:

    Arm your child to succeed in life?
    Help them be the best they can be in school?
    Develop their self confidence?
    Assist them in developing their unique potential?
    Learn self-discipline? 

Most parents do everything they can to teach these things to their children, but after school many parents need some help. The 2-4 hours that kids spend after school before their parents get home are some of the most important hours in a child's life. How is your child spending their time After School? Let’s look at this example: The average child spends 3-4 hours somewhere after school before their parents come home. A child in 1st to 7th grade spends about 200 days in school out of the year; this doesn’t even include the 8 hours a day for 2-3 months during the summer. 200 days times 3 hours is 600 hours a year a child spends doing what? Some go to babysitters. Some go home and play with their friends doing whatever they want. Others get into serious trouble. Not Our Students. Between the 1st and 7th grade a child spends an average of 4200 hours doing basically nothing productive. This time is more valuable than you know. In 4200 hours you could graduate from college, get your Masters Degree and your Ph.D. So why wouldn’t you let your child spend this valuable time learning skills that will last a lifetime? When our kids get out of school, their parents know that their child is being trained in real Life Skills. With our busy 21st century schedules, it's hard to find the time and resources to really help them with these important life skills. You would think and expect that they would learn about perseverance, positive mental attitudes, self-discipline and goal setting in school, but they really don't. Students who attend Champions Martial Arts Academy have an advantage over others because we teach them about these important life skills and how to develop them to their fullest! They learn success traits that will pay off for the rest of their lives. If you have a 3 to 13-year-old looking for something to do after school, look no further. Champions Mixed Martial Arts After School program will provide your child with structured study time, lessons in Martial Arts, stranger danger, anger management, conflict resolution, 911 awareness, fire safety, and much more. In one of the finest facilities in the country, your child will learn life lessons that will assure a future of success. Wouldn't it be nice to have your child enrolled in a program that is committed to keeping children away from drugs and gangs?

Mission Statement
InnerStrengths' mission is to be recognized as a Jiu Jitsu Martial Arts school with a positive learning environment for children,women and men that encourages growth in all aspects of its students' lives. This is done by teaching a form of martial arts that focuses on using technique and leverage as opposed to muscle and strength and also by frequent recognition for dedication, respect,team work,progress and achievements.";"http://www.innerstrengthsjiujitsu.com/InnerStrengths_Blue.jpg";"http://www.innerstrengthsjiujitsu.com/Children-s-Classes.html";"The safety of your child is the most important factor for your child training Jiu-Jitsu. Therefore, all necessary measures are taken to ensure your child's safety.  Ground rules are established with each student upon taking classes, as well as integrated into the structure of each class.  Direction is given to children on how, when and where use of their Jiu-Jitsu skills is appropriate.  Your child will be supervised closely by our trained professionals while participating in our classes.

At InnerStrengths we realize the value of your child's well being is equally as important as their safety, that is why we strive to bring out your child's wonderful attributes. 

InnerStrengths has the knowledge and understanding that children develop at different intervals. Rather than having your child attempt something and fail, we provide opportunities for your child to succeed continually.  This is done by accepting your child as an individual and targeting where they are developmentally.   The focus is on your child’s strengths as opposed to their weaknesses.  Our teaching methods provide an opportunity for your children to grow and gain more confidence. With encouragement and support, they can overcome their obstacles and challenges.

Your child will work on problem solving skills, positive thinking with an emphasis on character building, respect and teamwork. These skills will not only aid your child to succeed in Jiu-Jitsu but, they will also assist in forming positive habits for all aspects needed in life. 

What are the benefits of Jiu-Jitsu for Children?

Jiu-Jitsu will help your child improve their confidence, self-esteem, learn simple effective self-defense techniques for personal safety and against a bully. Your child will also have an increased awareness of who they are, build strength, improve overall fitness, balance and coordination while learning Jiu-Jitsu and having fun.

Children who have difficulty focusing and paying attention will stimulate the impulse control part of the brain by doing Jiu-Jitsu. Many children experience impulsivity. Although typically this part of the brain is not fully developed until the early to mid twenties, participating in activities that require such discipline and self-control such as Jiu-Jitsu foster the development of one’s ability to think before reacting.

InnerStrengths has developed a curriculum for a positive progression of ranking for your child. There is a move of the month that is practiced each class. From that move there is a sequence of positions and submissions added on to the initial move. Within a period of three months your child has been taught a series of techniques that coincide with the “base” move. At the end of the three months, your child joins us in a ranking ceremony where they earn either a new stripe on their belt or move on to the next color belt. Your child gets to demonstrate their acquired skill during this ceremony with their coaches, amongst their peers and anyone they wish to invite. Each student is also awarded a certificate for their accomplishment. Pictures and videos are available.";"http://www.innerstrengthsjiujitsu.com/Women-s-Classes.html";"InnerStrengths offers the opportunity for women to train Jiu-Jitsu.  Although all classes at InnerStrengths are taught in a safe, warm and friendly atmosphere, we understand the difficulties a woman might encounter, especially in the first stages of training.  If you would like to try jiu-jitsu or already have found that co-ed clases are not for you, InnerStrengths provides classes that are designed soley for women.  This provides the opportunity for you to train in an environment that might be more comfortable for you while you still have the advantage of learning the same jiu-jitsu principles and techniques. 

All women's classes are taught by skilled, dedicated women who have your best interest at heart.  We want you to be successful in your training, so InnerStrengths provides an opportunity for you to utilize your knowledge and ability to the fullest.  There is a huge emphasis on the female aspect which is key in confidence building along with identifying your strengths.

Whether you are training for self-defense, competition or sport, your training will be about you and reaching your personal goal.

I have found that jiu-jitsu is a great way for me to stay in shape and relieve stress. More importantly, it helps to keep a spiritual balance in my life.

4-6 year old ""Lil"" Ninja Martial Arts Program

We designed our “Lil' Ninja program to be fun, and to encourage self-discipline through physical activity. Large motor skills, such as punching and kicking are a great way for children to develop coordination and balance. Each class, the children participate in group activities, that help to foster a sense of camaraderie. By sharing common goals, many of the children have an easier time making friends and thus improve their social skills. Our certified and professional staff uses positive reinforcement to help build the child’s self-confidence and to help them develop a positive attitude.  Parents are often amazed at the improvements in the children’s self-discipline. Our accomplishment-based system of colored belts helps to teach the children to set and achieve goals. Listening skills improve and attention spans increase as the children strive to achieve their next colored belt. Our staff works closely with you to make sure that all of your goals are reached as well!

7-12 Children Martial Arts
​

There are many benefits for children who train in the martial arts. While most parents expect their children to learn the basic tenets of self-defense in our classes, many are surprised when their children’s martial arts training also carries over into other aspects of their lives. We designed our rules-based children’s program to be fun and to help them to develop physically, mentally and socially. Our certified and professional staff follows and teaches five rules to help the children progress in our achievement-based system of colored belts. These rules are:

 

·           Effort – All students are encouraged to do their best. We believe that continuous effort is the key to unlocking potential.

·           Etiquette - We base our program on respect. We teach our students to respect the instructors, each other, and most importantly, themselves.

·           Sincerity – Honesty is important in the martial arts. Being honest about your weaknesses is the first step to improving them!

·           Character - Honesty, courage, optimism, and integrity are all qualities we try to instill in our students. All are traits of a positive attitude!

·           Self Control – Determination and concentration developed through self-discipline.

 

Many of the activities the children engage in will help to improve their overall physical fitness. Over time, our specifically designed workouts will help the children to develop strength and stamina. Moreover, large motor skills, such as kicking and punching aid in the development of coordination and balance. Parents oftentimes see a noticeable improvement in the children’s self-discipline and dispositions as they learn and follow the five rules. Attention spans increase, and listening skills improve as the children strive to achieve the proficiency necessary to receive their next colored belt.  Friendships often develop between the students as they share common goals and work together to learn self-defensetechniques.

BJJ is a modern adaptation of the 2000 year old martial art of Japanese JuJitsu. Things have changed rapidly over the last 100 years in our culture yet very few martial arts have grown with the times. Machado Jiu-Jitsu, created by the famous Machado Brothers, offers a very modern twist on self-defense.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu’s fundamental fight strategy is to take the attacker to the ground, establish control, and end the conflict on the ground.

A startling number of fights will end on the ground. How do I know this? Striking with the hands or feet requires that the distance between opponents is carefully managed so that both can strike on target. The moment one fighter decides to take a step back, or forward, it becomes very difficult for the other person to land quality blows without the proper spacing. Too much distance and strikes can’t reach the target. Too little distance between fighters and you can’t build enough momentum to get in a powerful shot. In fact, it takes professional boxers years to learn how to manage the distance in a fight.

If the distance between fighters is managed properly a BJJ Practitioner can take an attacker to the ground without injury. Once the fight hits the ground all the rules change.
From Japan to Brazil: The birth of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

In the early 1900’s, heavy migration from Japanese colonies took place in Northeastern Brazil. Among the several immigrants, there was a samurai of the time, whose name was Maeda Koma. He was the head of the Japanese immigration for the region. He was also a highly accomplished Jiu-Jitsu champion in Japan, and a well respected master of that art. His effort to settle in Brazil was greatly assisted by a diplomat named Gastao Gracie. Gastao was very instrumental in providing entry visas to Maeda and his group. Maeda became grateful and fond of Gastao’s support.

Gastao was the father of eight children, including four boys (Carlos, Jorge, Osvaldo and Helio). His oldest son, Carlos Gracie, was a skinny and hyper-active child, constantly giving headaches to his parents for his erratic behavior. It did not take long for Maeda Koma to learn from his friend Gastao about the difficulties in raising Carlos. Soon Maeda offered to teach his friend’s son the art of Jiu-Jitsu, a secret only reserved for nationals of Japan. Carlos became the only non-japanese student at the exclusive Dojo of master Koma.

After a few eventful classes, the youngster Carlos Gracie found a new path in his life. Within a few years since he started, he passed to his younger brothers Jorge, Osvaldo and Helio what he knew from Maeda’s teachings. That was the initial step in the building of a saga that transformed martial arts worldwide. The Gracie family eventually became a notorious and legendary clan, the ambassadors of an art they considerably improved throughout five generations. They were the creators of what later became known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, one of the most revolutionary martial arts systems in the world.
Carlos Machado and Brothers

Carlos Machado was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He is the eldest of the five Machado Brothers, including Roger, Rigan, Jean Jacques and John. He started learning martial arts when he was four. His main instructor throughout his life has been his cousin Carlos Gracie Jr., although he thanks greatly other names also involved in his upbringing in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Those include Helio Gracie, Carlson Gracie, Rolls Gracie, Rickson Gracie, Crolin Gracie and Rilion Gracie, and last but not the least, all his brothers. While in Brazil, he has successfully competed in several tournaments at state and national level. In April of 1990 he decided to move to Los Angeles, California, pursuing more prospects in his martial arts career. There he met martial arts movie star Chuck Norris, who was instrumental in promoting Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and his family. Since then, Mr. Norris has been one of the greatest advocates of Machado Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Carlos lived in Los Angeles until end of 1995, when once more he chose to move to the Southwest, to the city of Dallas, Texas. There he established his first location, at the same building where the Chuck Norris’ TV show “Walker, Texas Ranger” was filmed. That allowed Carlos not only to teach at his studio, but also to take part in many episodes of that popular show. He often assisted on choreographing fight scenes with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Besides running his school, Carlos has also been involved in competition, winning twice the Pan American of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (97/98), several events in the U.S. (U.S Open 98/99), and the World Master’s Championships (2000) in two weight divisions (middle weight and open class).

He currently holds the highest rank of this style in the Southwest (9th Degree Black Belt).

He has been at his current location since April of 1999, where he has had a chance to develop an incredible group of dedicated students, many of them outstanding competitors themselves.

Carlos has built one of the fastest growing affiliate school programs in the country, which now includes representatives in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Philadelphia, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Mississippi, South Carolina, England, France, Australia and Mexico.

From Brazil to America: Tim Burrill
One of the first Americans to receive a black belt from Carlos Machado, Tim not only brings the philosophy and technique of Machado BJJ, but also other talents and his own personal way of teaching, making his style of BJJ unique from all others.

Tim cultivates a friendly, open atmosphere where learning comes naturally and the techniques are 100% effective. Tim’s philosophy, as is the Machado Brothers, is not to prove or impose our system on other styles of martial arts, but to share what we have with open minds.

Prior to discovering BJJ, Tim earned a black belt from Sifu Rick Fowler in Kenpo Karate and experimented with many different styles of Martial Arts – Kali, Tai Chi, Shotokan, and Wrestling to name a few. Tim is Also an accomplished Sport BJJ fighter with 7+ years of competition experience.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/12920451_10153916366370155_1126310378954360124_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=2c8f6d3589101351dd15a85e8e50fde5&oe=5B3395EE";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Tai Chi";"http://timburrill.com/pricing/";"http://timburrill.com/schedule/";"N/A";"Carlos Machado";"N/A";"burrill1@hotmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/TB2JJ/";"N/A";"N/A";"N/A";"Yes";

That's why we don't believe in contracts or hidden fees.  

We believe that our students should stick to our program because they absolutely love it, not because they have to.  

And when we put our students first, they speak for us:  

That's why we have 60+ reviews on Google, and the reviews aren't brief statements: sometimes they are paragraphs long.

Most of all, our dojo is a family.

We understand nothing is more important or more valuable to a parent than their children. 

That's why we've created a positive, welcoming, and judgment-free atmosphere that many of our students describe as feeling like family.  Each child is given individual attention by true mentors- they are never lost in a crowd. 

We are on a mission to serve families all over Rhode Island, and help kids grow into adults that are equipped with the principles, mindset, and techniques to live the life of their dreams.

Dear Parents and Family......

Hello, I would like to personally introduce myself. My name is Sasha Komocar and I am the Owner and Master Instructor here at Superior Martial Arts and Fitness.

I moved to Rhode Island just over 10 years ago from Toronto, Canada and have made Cranston my new home with my wife and family.

Originally I came here to help train future Olympic Taekwondo Athletes, because I brought with me a wealth of knowledge and experiences as a Semi Professional Soccer Player and having trained with Professional Athletes and Trainers including Olympic athletes and Military groups.

My background was in Banking and I found my new passion in teaching children and having the honor and privilege to make an impact on their lives. I have great satisfaction in sharing with them all the struggles and successes I have had in achieving a persevering mindset and attitude which contributed to both my amateur and  professional accomplishments.

My job as I view it, is simple....it is helping others find their inner strength and reach their full potential.

The only obstacle we have is the battle we have every day with ourselves. We choose to be either the Warrior or the Victim, and my goal is the help each individual find that Peaceful Warrior within them! I would be my honor and pleasure to have you and your family be a part of the Superior Martial Arts Family!

Thanks,
Sasha Komocar

""I feel the secret to creating confidence in children is to give them tasks and challenges that are obtainable but difficult to obtain.   Especially today, I see so many kids try something once and if they do it, they feel like they've got it and don't need to practice.  If they fail in that 1st or 2nd attempt, then they want to quit.  If they learn how to fail and recognize themselves getting better every time they practice, then they will accomplish the task or challenge and achieve true confidence.  A confidence that is based on a real success.  A success based on multiple failures. . . just like life.""

Our goal is to help men, women and children gain the discipline and confidence they need to succeed and to give them a fun and exciting way to maintain a healthy lifestyle. At Masters Studios, we are always looking for ways to better serve our clients. You deserve the best and we do our best to meet and exceed your expectations.

The 5 Major Elements of Martial Arts Training at Masters Studios:

Mental Focus
The student is taught to be fully aware of the five senses. In class, the student is trained to be aware of what is happening both inside and outside the body. Learning new movements and techniques enhance the ability to think, process and learn. A student will demonstrate mental focus by the ability to follow direction and by the incorporation of new ideas

Physical Conditioning
Physical training is a big part of the training at Masters Studios. The five basics include punching, kicking, blocking, stances, and movement from stance to stance. Conditioning also includes strengthening muscle, stretching, range of motion, breathing, balance, rooting, and plyometric movement. You will never get bored due to constantly varying routines.

Technique
Technique includes defensive maneuvers against punches, kicks, weapons, and choking and grabbing situations from both single and multiple attackers. Traditional martial arts form (or kata) are also included in our curriculum. These include Kempo, Kung Fu, Wushu, and weapons forms.

Strategy
Strategy is the ability to fluidly fit the technique coupled with physical conditioning to handly a wide range of situations. The student is taught to handle situations ranging from annoying to an outright attack. This response should be appropriate to each situation.

Lifestyle
A healthy lifestyle is the natural progression as a student begins to feel the mental and physical benefits of his commitment to training. Confidence, health, and pride coupled with humility is the goal for every black belt.

We offer programs for the beginning student to the more advanced. We have separate classes for beginners and advanced students, allowing each individual to progress at his or her own pace.

Our professional, qualified instructors will help you achieve your goals whether they are to get in shape, train, or to become a martial arts master. And, they’ll show you how to have fun while doing it. The fundamentals of Shaolin Kempo Karate also teaches a very valuable skill – restraint when provoked and defense when attacked. The confidence gained through this art will allow you to walk away from a confrontation without loss of self-respect and will give you the ability to handle a physical assault with skill and control.";"https://scontent.fdac6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/185018_405236636200792_2031401165_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=4bccfa863b283266872780899bdffe3f&oe=5B730051";"http://mastersstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/northcharlestonschedule2017.pdf";"Classes for CHILDREN:

What is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu?
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art, combat sport, and a self-defense system that focuses on grappling, take-downs, and most importantly ground fighting. It originated from the japanese fighting style of Judo and refined to what it is today in Brazil through Helio Gracie (father of BJJ). If you would like to learn more about the History of BJJ Click here. It is a growing sport that is starting to get traction in the international scene in part by the Ulitmate Fighter Championship (UFC). There are many reasons for your kids to do BJJ but I will narrow it down to just 5 of the top reasons why your kids should do BJJ.

Health

In 2012 the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that 33% of American children and adolescent were overweight or obese. Obesity is caused by a “caloric imbalance”, fancy way of saying eating more calories than you burn, which increases lipids (fats) in your body and affects ones weight, hormones, and even psychological health.

Studies show that exposing kids early on to sports such as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) and other athletic activities are more likely to maintain healthier lifestyles throughout their life. The only way to maintain good health is to build a lifestyle around it and BJJ is a great way to start. Not to mention BJJ is known as an excellent way to build strong bones and muscles.

Note: ***Before signing up for BJJ make sure to check with your pediatrician to see if your child is ok to train. ***

Improved Grades

Psychology Today recently released an article directly correlating sports and improved cognitive intelligence. BJJ is a great form of physical aerobic activity that helps promote Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factors (BDNF), this chemical in the brain helps promote the growth of new neurons and may lead to an increase in your child’s Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and help with performance in school leading to better grades.

Physical activity like BJJ can also improve concentration and focus and may aid with some children that suffer of ADHD.

Self-Defense
The ability to defend oneself is a very valuable skill that every child should learn. BJJ gives your child the tools to be able to do so. But don’t think your child will just be picking fights with everyone, BJJ promotes respect and discipline and many instructors teach their students to never use what you learn in class in public unless absolutely necessary.

Promotes Leadership and Goal Driveness
BJJ is a sports which its practitioners are separated by ranks, white belts being a beginner and black belts being those with the highest level of experience. Rank is increase based on a combination of tournament performance and time spent learning BJJ. Ceremonies are held when someone is awarded a higher rank similar to a graduation in a sense.

This type of environment promotes a child to strive to achieve their goal of receive a higher rank. In the long run BJJ creates a goal driven mind that will aid in future endeavors such as college, careers, and beyond.

Improved self-esteem through friendship and bonding

The way one feels can govern how one behaves. Low self-esteem has been linked with dangerous behaviors. Doing BJJ is a great way to build a strong sense of self through meaningful and lasting friendships that you gain rolling on those mats.

Many BJJ gyms have after school and summer programs that offer separate classes were kids are able to converse and train in a safe environment.

**Maybe consider learning BJJ with your child and have a common interest to bond in.

Overall BJJ is a great sport for your child to get into aside from the top 5 reason stated above BJJ has many more too long to list in this blog.

Maybe you know this already, but in case you don’t, allow us to explain: In the last decade or two, the martial arts have taken a 100 year leap. Television, the Internet, the ease of international travel, and an eruption of interest in all things martial arts has made “what style” a school teaches a far less telling or important thing than it used to be.

Aikido, Jiu-Jitsu, Karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Savate, Judo, and all other arts are, quite literally, “brand names” and —fortunately —education, good ideas, and sound practices don’t know what brand names are. So, we teach an eclectic mix of the best things we know, have studied, and believe in.

If you’re an experienced practitioner and you’re looking for a specific kind of training, please call our front desk and we’ll connect you with our head instructor. If you’re a beginner or the parent of a beginner, we’d like you to appreciate that our “style” is based on sound, traditional martial arts. What we think is most important is the way our staff teaches. We’ll tell you we’re fantastic teachers, but the best way to see exactly what we do in our classroom is to take us up on our offer of a week-long introductory course.

The “Introductory” isn’t a sales pitch, it’s a genuine hands-on way to see how our team interacts with your child, what we do, physically, with young people, and to hear precisely what kind of ideas we’re talking with them about.";"http://www.familyfirstma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/web_logo.png";"http://www.familyfirstma.com/classes/karatekids/";"KARATE For KIDS  Ages 8 to 12

Sound Interesting So Far?

I know that getting started can be difficult. Many schools make it confusing with “Long Term Contracts” or “Basic Programs” that force you into “Upgrading” to a Black Belt Club or Masters Program 3 to 6 months into training. I assure you that we are not one of those schools. What you see is what you get with us. We are of the belief that we earn your business, not force you to continue with long term contracts. Additionally we don’t force you to upgrade to additional programs so you can advance in rank or trick you with hidden fees periodically. The only other fee you will have is a $25 testing fee every quarter. So… If this sounds like your cup of tea, come check us out for a week on me. Seriously.. No Obligation, No Pushy Sales Pitch to “sign up now and we’ll Waive Your Enrollment Fee”.

A life that includes the experience of Martial Arts training will benefit you in a multitude of ways, many that will be obvious early in your commitment and others that will be discovered along the way. It is no wonder why people all over the world have been practicing martial arts for thousands of years. Teaching for over 45 years in Korea and The United States, I have seen so many students who not only achieved their personal goals for training but were able to use the confidence and perspective they gained to make the world a better place and more peaceful place. We have designed an in depth curriculum to guide you through a thorough education in the martial arts. The goal for our students is the same today as it was 40 years ago, to improve your body and mind so that your quality of life is long and healthy. We hope you will come and experience what so many others have and see the benefits for you and your family.

Our goal for Junior students is to develop both physical and mental skills using the traditions and training of the martial arts. These include physical coordination, balance, agility, endurance and self-defense. Also, we teach mental focus, self-control, positive attitude, confidence and perseverance. We want our students to enjoy their training and have fun, but we want the younger students, especially, to appreciate how these qualities build life skills and character.

Children learn character building like respect, self-control, confidence, and manners. Taekwondo is great exercise while learning self-defense in a fun and exciting environment.

Our Junior Taekwondo classes are designed for 7-12 year olds. They meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays (4:45-5:25 p.m.) and Saturdays mornings (10:05 a.m.) These classes accommodate all belt ranks (levels). If the times are inconvenient for you, we can provide options—just ask. We recommend attending 2 to 3 times per week for maximum benefit.

Please visit our school and observe a class. We can even arrange a free trial if you like. Afterwards, we can meet privately, and I will answer any questions you might have. Thanks for your interest. Let us hear from you soon.

We pledge to uphold standards of excellence that inspire students to see beyond their current potential and reach new levels of personal success.

History
Memphis Judo & Jiu-Jitsu was founded by David Ferguson, Joel Gingery & Mike Ostrowski in October of 2003 in the University of Memphis area. Beginning with only adult evening classes in Judo & Jiu-Jitsu (hence our name), we began to expand our programs adding Muay Thai Kickboxing, Submission Wrestling, Children’s Judo & Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).

After 3 successful years of growth, Memphis Judo & Jiu-Jitsu was busting at the seams and a re-location was needed. We needed to be able to have more classes going on at the same time, space for more training equipment and a location that was heated and air-conditioned.

We opened our Bartlett facility on April 2, 2007 decked it out with: 4 full sized Muay Thai kickboxing bags, boxing equipment, Muay Thai pads, and a huge 2,100 sq. ft. Olympic tatami matted grappling area as well as 1600 sq. ft. of kickboxing flooring. Soon we added new programs and training equipment. In January 2008 we added Boxing, Fitness Kickboxing, Filipino MA and Children’s Jiu-Jitsu. In addition to the new programs added 20 full size leather kickboxing bags, 4 leather boxing bags, 3 speed bags, weight lifting/fitness equipment and a full size boxing ring.

In January 2011 we moved to our current 24,000 sq. ft. location near Wolfchase Gallaria. We have now expanded our classes, added another 1500 sq. ft. matted grappling area, a full size 24 ft. MMA cage as well as added on to our Fitness Kickboxing bag stand with an additional 10 bags (31 total Fitness Kickboxing bags now).

In 2013 we added a new Fitness Boxing program along with a new bag stand with 10 Boxing bags.  We have also added new Muay Thai equipment as well as adding Memphis’s first Indoor Fitness Bootcamp program.

Memphis Judo & Jiu-Jitsu is home to many competitive champions who train under the most decorated and professional mixed martial arts instructors in the Mid-South.";"https://d3926qxcw0e1bh.cloudfront.net/pages_avatar_photos/50/b5/50b5467338ec2686bc37c82a6990d56e.jpg";"http://www.memphisbjj.com/styles/kids-judo-jiu-jitsu/";"Kids Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu(Ages 5 – 13)
