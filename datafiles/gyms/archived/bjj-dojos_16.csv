Focusing on building confidence and coordination through dynamic warm ups and fun games. For this age group we put a strong emphasis on teaching throwing and falling to build a strong body, good balance and the confidence to attempt learned techniques. The Youth (8-12 years old) BJJ program is designed to build our students a strong foundation and overall understanding of BJJ. The lesson plan ranges from self-defense and dealing with bullying, basic and fundamental techniques, proper etiquette as a martial artist all the way to competition preparation.  In many ways our Youth program mirrors our Adult White Belt Curriculum.";"http://stratfordbjj.com/classes/";"Our Women’s Only BJJ program is quickly becoming one of the most popular and well attended at the academy. Normally schools start a women’s only class as a way of recruiting ladies to the gym, whereas ours was initiated due to the sheer number of women already training here at Stratford BJJ. We have added more classes lately as the program continues to grow. The program is beginner friendly, and follows our BJJ Basics curriculum closely. This is a great way to train with like minded individuals in an incredibly supportive environment for any women looking to start something new.

One significant difference that most parents notice right away is that jiu-jitsu is a ""grappling"" art. Meaning, jiu-jitsu techniques focus on taking an aggressor to the ground, and then stopping their attack with a pin or hold. This may seem like an ineffective strategy to the untrained person, but it's actually incredibly effective. And, it's great self-defense training for kids. In other arts, the only options a child might have are strikes and kicks. But in jiu-jitsu, kids are trained to control an attacker and then neutralize their attack using the least amount of force necessary. This approach works great for kids, because they don't have to hurt another kid to defend themselves. Most kids are hesitant to throw a punch, and for good reason. But with jiu-jitsu, they can defend themselves without reservation, because they know they can do so without injuring the other child.";;;;;"http://submissionartsacademy.com/179-2/";;"Spencer Lalonde";;"info@submissionartsacademy.com";"https://www.facebook.com/SubmissionArtsAcademy";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTpDuYGb-goBTjUJ30oqk-g";"https://youtu.be/XZNyDFDD0EE?t=11";;1;;

It became popular after Royce Gracie, a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter, defeated many much larger and stronger opponents in the UFC. He was able to do this by using grappling holds to efficiently and effectively out maneuver his much larger and stronger opponents until he was able to apply a submission hold, forcing them to submit and clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the martial art. The benefits of BJJ are far more reaching than being a highly effective form of combat and self-defense. At Team DNA, we believe that through BJJ, you will begin to learn a lot more about yourself as you will be constantly testing your limits and evolving into a better martial artist. The same principles that you will be learning in class can also be applied to your life to help you become a better person. You will begin to think more constructively through life's problems and will slowly come to realize that the sky is the limit for whatever goals it is that you wish to accomplish; be it losing weight, increasing self-confidence and dealing with stress in a more proactive way. At Team DNA we are a family that is dedicated to the continual improvement of every one of our members on and off the mats.

The order in which you learn the techniques of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu greatly affects the time it takes for you to master the art.

The Little Champs secret is that we have devised a series of 10 ""Gracie Games"" in which we secretly teach the children essential self-defense techniques. By playing the fun and challenging ""Gracie Games,"" children develop strong reflexes in the execution of the basic techniques as they unconsciously learn the foundational principles of leverage and control. Jr. Grapplers (8-14 Years Old) - Empower your child when they need it most. Since bullying is most prevalent in this age group, we teach the children in the Jr. Grapplers class the techniques they must know in order to defend themselves if attacked. The best part about the techniques is that they are all non-violent control tactics designed to minimize injury to the bully if used during a real fight. Black Belt Club (Invitation Only) - If they have the fire, we'll feed it! Only the most disciplined children are invited to join the Black Belt Club, and receiving the invitation is the highest honor for any child student. The final objective in the Black Belt Club is to instill in each child the dedication and discipline needed to make it to Black Belt. The Gracie Character Development Program - What makes the GRACIE BULLYPROOF program unique is that we develop your child's character as well as their confidence. During each class, we dedicate a few minutes to discussing a featured character trait and the simple things your child can do to make it part of their everyday lives. The secret to our success lies in our incentive-based point system that is specifically designed to keep your child excited about making daily progress! Certified BULLYPROOF Belt Holders - As your child progresses through the curriculum, he/she will be awarded belts according to the Edmonton Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Youth Ranking System. The list of all Certified BULLYPROOF Belt Holders can be viewed at www.GracieKids.com, and as soon as your child earns their white-yellow belt (the first belt after white belt), their name will be added to the list!";"http://www.graciejiujitsusaultstemarie.com/womenempowered.html";"Women Empowered is a comprehensive self-defense program for women based on proven verbal, physical, and psychological defense strategies tested and proven effective over nearly two decades. Self-defense begins long before the fight gets physical. Your first and most important line of defense is a heightened sense of awareness. Women Empowered teaches you the most common strategies used by both strangers and non-stranger assailants so you can prevent attacks before they happen. However, no matter how diligently you practice awareness and avoidance techniques, someone might slip through your defenses and attack you. Regardless of your age or physical condition, you CAN and SHOULD defend yourself, and the Women Empowered program will give you the tools and the confidence to make it happen. The Women Empowered program is unique in that it is effective for all women, and it is the only self-defense program that effectively addresses what to do at all four phases of a sexual assault. Through correspondence with law enforcement officials and reports submitted by survivors, we've discovered that nearly all sexual assaults follow the same four-phase strategy: 1) Identify an unsuspecting target, 2) Subdue the target, 3) Exhaust the target, and 4) Execute the sexual assault";;;"http://www.graciejiujitsusaultstemarie.com/schedule.html";;"Chris Giallonardo";"10-day free trial period before signing up";"info@graciejiujitsu.ca";"https://www.facebook.com/Gracie-Jiu-Jitsu-Sault-Ste-Marie-487116528018638/";;;;1;;

The original Thornhill location was the Greater Toronto Area's first dedicated mixed martial arts fitness club, and it serviced the Vaughan community for 10 years. Our membership grew steadily over time, and by our 10th anniversary we knew that we needed to expand. With a significant percentage of our members living north of the 407 Expressway, we felt that the Langstaff and Dufferin area was perfect to open a new location that would be convenient to our members and their families. It also offered the added benefit to being close to the expressway (407/Dufferin), granting our members who live in Woodbridge, Maple, Richmond Hill, Thornhill, King City, and the surrounding area easy access. The layout of our new Vaughan location is much more open concept and boasts a dedicated kick boxing ring, a regulation UFC sized octagon, two boxing rings and one of the largest unobstructed matted areas in the GTA. We also have a brand new heavy bag configuration, which includes a ton of new uppercut bags as well as double end bags for boxing. With the new layout we can now lead multiple classes at once, which allows not only for improved flexibility in scheduling but also for parents to maximize their time by training while their kids have their lessons. They can alternatively spend time in the brand new open concept parents' lounge while spectating our high-energy, dynamic, and fun classes. We have the same awesome instructors as our Toronto and old Thornhill locations, so the transition to the new space has been seamless for all of our members. Even before Rev MMA's opening, it's co-owners and chief instructors at the Vaughn location Joel Gerson and Ranny Tal provided mixed martial arts training and fitness conditioning for over a quarter of a century. The staff at Rev MMA have a proven track record of experience and professionalism that can transform even the most out of shape, non-athlete into someone who is in the best shape of their life, while still giving a challenging workout to a seasoned expert. Fronting onto Langstaff, our brand new facility offers convenient showers, lockers, and free parking, while providing martial arts and fitness classes at every level, for all age groups, whether you are just starting out or have been fitness conscious for years. At Rev kids develop self-confidence, focus, and social skills through classes specifically tailored to their age group. Teens can take fitness classes or use the MMA program to learn valuable self-defense techniques while getting in shape. Adults have the option of many martial arts and fitness classes to choose from, including boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Krav Maga, Combat Fitness, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

He competed in the some of the first competitions, winning five (5) National titles from 1996-2000 and represented Canada in the World Kobudo Federation’s Grappling Championship, winning Gold twice in 1999 and 2000. Returning to competition in 2014 after a 10-year hiatus, he won Gold at the IBJJF No-Gi World Championship and again at the IBJJF Pan-American Championship in 2015 (both at Masters Black Belt, Featherweight Division). Salvosa was also among Canada’s first International MMA competitors with bouts in France (Ultrafight) and Japan (Shooto). One of Canada’s most authentic Black Belts in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Professor Salvosa holds a 3rd Degree Black Belt and is Ontario’s senior representative of Master Marcus Soares, 8th Degree Black Belt under Carlson Gracie Sr. He established his own team in 1998, which evolved into Team Ascension.

Our primary aim is to help provide your child with the necessary life tools required for success both in martial arts (specifically Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) and in the real world! In our society, it is important for us to acknowledge the reality faced by our children everyday. Unfortunately, we cannot solely rely on our school systems to ensure that kids are protected from bullying, physical and verbal abuse from negative social networks. Obeisity and inactivity (eg. excessive video game playing—no exercise whatsoever), among other physical and social challenges leads to an erosion of their confidence. Although some extracurricular activities might provide our children with an outlet for physical expression and development, they are sometimes too competitive to give a healthy balance, or sometimes too narrow and superficial to help gauge and develop emotional wellbeing in our kids. There must be something deeper, something more meaningful to help our kids to conquer their fears and achieve their goals. Our BJJ KIDS program uniquely delivers the encouragement, resources and fundamental skill set that will transform your child into a confident and self-aware individual. Our classes always include the right amount of physical exercise through our warmups, drills and sparring to keep your child active and healthy.

Every school aims at fulfilling Master Carlos Gracie Jr’s vision of bringing the benefits of martial arts and self-defense to everyone. The benefits of Gracie Barra BJJ are far-reaching and will touch every aspect of your life. At GB, our students become leaders. The practice of martial arts nurtures your independent thinking, supports your fighting spirit, and helps you achieve your personal BJJ goals. Through GB BJJ, you will begin to understand yourself, on and off the mats, in ways you never imagined. You will test your limits and become the best you can be. GB respects that each student has their own goals and we support you in reaching them. The more you train jiu-jitsu, the better you will become and the more completely you will reach your true potential in life. GB BJJ is for anyone who wants to learn how to defend him or herself in combat. What most people don’t know, is that Jiu-Jitsu will also allow you to apply those same principles when fighting the daily battles of life; like weight loss, boredom, stress, relationship issues, and self-confidence. You will learn how to think through problems more constructively than before, on and off the mats. At Gracie Barra Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, you are a part of an extended family. You will join a team that will support you in your quest for self-improvement. Training the techniques and participating in live training sessions, with your partners and coaches, will give you an arsenal of weapons at your disposal whenever you should need them. The more you train jiu-jitsu, the more you will arm yourself with knowledge and skills to fight all your battles in life like a black belt.";"http://gbsainteanne.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo_round.png";"http://gbsainteanne.ca/class/kidsteens/";"To excel in any endeavour, individuals need to have a strong set of values and a solid character that gives them the perseverance to achieve his or her goals.

As a contact sport, Gracie Barra Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provides a very challenging yet safe and caring environment for a child to mature towards a real-life champion. The outcome of continued childhood practice of BJJ goes far beyond the accomplishments on the mats.

This is done by using technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint locks and chokeholds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations. Sparring (commonly referred to as ""rolling"" within the BJJ community) and live drilling play a major role in training and the practitioner's development.

"Evolution BJJ Petawawa";"http://www.evolutionbjjpetawawa.com/";;"57 Festubert Blvd., Building P-118";"Petawawa";"ON";"K8H 2X3";;"Canada";"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art, combat sport and a self-defense system focused upon the ground fighting aspects of grappling. The art was brought to Brazil by Japanese Judo legend, Mitsuyo Maeda. Maeda was one of five of Judo's top groundwork experts that Judo's founder Jigoro Kano sent overseas to demonstrate and spread his art to the world. Maeda had trained first in sumo as a teenager, and after the interest generated by stories about the success of Judo at contests between Judo and Jujutsu that were occurring at the time, he changed from sumo to Judo, becoming a student of Kano's Kodokan Judo. Maeda left Japan in 1904 and visited a number of countries giving ""jiu-do"" demonstrations and accepting challenges from wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters and various other martial artists before eventually arriving in Brazil on November 14, 1914. Gastão Gracie was a business partner of the American Circus in Belem. In 1916, Italian Argentine circus Queirolo Brothers staged shows there and presented Maeda to Gastão. In 1917, Carlos Gracie, the eldest son of Gastão Gracie, watched a demonstration by Maeda at the Da Paz Theatre and decided to learn Judo. Maeda accepted Carlos as a student and Carlos learned for a few years, eventually passing his knowledge on to his four brothers. At age fourteen, Helio Gracie, the youngest of the Gracie brothers, moved in with his older brothers who lived and taught Jiu-Jitsu in a house in Botafogo. Following a doctor's recommendations, Hélio would spend the next few years being limited to watching his brothers teach as he was naturally frail. Over time, Hélio gradually developed Gracie Jiu-Jitsu as an adaptation from Judo, as he was unable to perform many Judo moves.  Helio also held the rank of 6th dan in Judo.";"http://www.evolutionbjjpetawawa.com/uploads/4/5/2/6/45266453/gym-bag-design_orig.jpg";"http://www.evolutionbjjpetawawa.com/bjj-youth-programs.html";"Little Warriors (Age 5-6) - This class is for children ages 5 to 6 years old and is designed to give them a head start in BJJ by using interactive games to teach basic techniques and concepts.

Instruction is designed to further develop the basic techniques while adding more to the students’ knowledge base. This class is used as a “bridge” between the Beginner and the Advance classes in order to prepare them for the more complex techniques that are taught in the Advance Class. Students remain in this class until the Jr. Yellow is achieved. Students in this class typically are still wearing a white belt (but achieved stripes) or a grey belt.

This style though previously established in its native country, became highly popular within the northern hemisphere after a series of performances from BJJ fighter Royce Gracie in the early UFC’s (Ultimate Fighting Championship) where he battled against competitors from many different martial arts backgrounds in the no holds barred tournament, becoming the fighting promotion’s first champion.

During each class, we dedicate a few minutes to discussing a featured character trait and the simple things your child can do to make it part of their everyday lives. The secret to our success lies in our incentive-based point system that is specifically designed to keep your child excited about making daily progress! Tiny Champs (ages 3-4) - You wanted it we brought it! For the teeniest of the tiniest we have…well of course Tiny Champs. We put the tiny ones in gis (uniforms), and yes we have gis THAT small. We do some moves and hang out for the cutest 30 minute Jiu-Jitsu session of the week! This class will prepare your child for group interactions, build confidence in public speaking and ultimately for the next level, Little Champs. Little Champs (ages 5-7)  - We don’t teach jiu-jitsu, we play jiu-jitsu! The Little Champs secret is that we have devised a series of “Gracie Games” in which we secretly teach the children essential self-defense techniques. By playing the fun and challenging “Gracie Games,” children develop strong reflexes in the execution of the basic techniques as they unconsciously learn the foundational principles of leverage and control. Jr Grapplers (ages 8-13) - Empower your child when they need it most. Since bullying is most prevalent in this age group, we teach the children in the Jr. Grapplers class the techniques they must know in order to defend themselves if attacked. The best part about the techniques is that they are all non-violent control tactics designed to minimize injury to the bully if used during a real fight. Black Belt Club (invitation only) - If they have the fire, we’ll feed it! Only the most disciplined children are invited to join the Black Belt Club, and receiving the invitation is the highest honor for any child student. The final objective in the Black Belt Club is to instill in each child the dedication and discipline needed to make it to Black Belt.";"https://edmontongraciejiujitsu.com/women-empowered-edmonton-jiujitsu/";"Self-defense begins long before the fight gets physical. Your first and most important line of defense is a heightened sense of awareness. Women Empowered teaches you the most common strategies used by both strangers and non-stranger assailants so you can prevent attacks before they happen. However, no matter how diligently you practice awareness and avoidance techniques, someone might slip through your defenses and attack you. Regardless of your age or physical condition, you CAN and SHOULD defend yourself, and the Women Empowered program will give you the tools and the confidence to make it happen. The Women Empowered program is unique in that it is effective for all women, and it is the only self-defense program that effectively addresses what to do at all four phases of a sexual assault. Through correspondence with law enforcement officials and reports submitted by survivors, we’ve discovered that nearly all sexual assaults follow the same four-phase strategy: 1) Identify an unsuspecting target, 2) Subdue the target, 3) Exhaust the target, and 4) Execute the sexual assault.";;;"https://edmontongraciejiujitsu.com/pricing-schedule/";;"Jeff Greekas";;"info@edmontongraciejiujitsu.com";"https://www.facebook.com/Edmonton-Gracie-Jiu-Jitsu-108529552605397/";;;;1;;

He is a 5th Degree Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt - the highest ranked Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt in Alberta and among the highest ranked in Canada. Born in Petrópolis, Rio de Janiero, Brazil, a small town in the southeast region of Brazil, his love for jiu jitsu started at the age of 14 when he met mentor and teacher, Aloisio Silva. After receiving his blue belt when he was 15 years old, he moved to Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro with Aloisio Silva to join Aloisio's ""Team Dojo"". As a young determined athlete, he spent countless hours at the gym with Aloisio and trained 2-3 times every day. With intense perseverance and training, he obtained his black belt from Aloisio Silva at the age of 20. Anderson's lineage can be traced down to the Gracie line, in that, Aloisio Silva received his black belt under Master Carlos Robson Gracie, son of Carlos Gracie. In 1999, Anderson moved to Orange County, California with Aloisio and had the great honor of finding a master of life who became a dear friend and mentor, Master Joe Moreira. Master Joe Moreira is an 8th degree Coral Red and White belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, 3rd degree Black Belt in Judo, a former UFC veteran, and the current President of the United States Federation of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Under the tutelage of Master Joe Moreira, Anderson became part of Team Punishment, training world-renowned former UFC champions such as Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson and Tito Ortiz. Master Moreira's rank is an admirable one, as it is received by one of only 6 Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Red Belts in the world, Master Francisco Mansor. Master Mansor was awarded his Red Belt (9th degree) by the Father of Jiu Jitsu himself, the late Grand Master Helio Gracie. Anderson then moved to Calgary, Alberta, and opened the doors to AG Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 2005. The rest is history! He continues to train the highest-level champions on both the local and international BJJ championship scenes, as well at the most reputable and sought-out MMA shows.
