We take a great deal of pride in what we teach and have a passion for sharing the knowledge we have gained from our own training. Students are encouraged to choose from any or all of the programs we offer. You can mix and match what your want to learn. Some people only choose one program while others are interested in training in all of the programs. One of the hidden upsides to training at Mass BJJ is the community that has been built around both schools.

In 2010, she opened SLS Fitness Strength and Conditioning Center in Lowell, MA and since that time the Center has expanded from 7,500 to 18,000 square feet. SLS Fitness also manages corporate fitness centers within Network Drive in Burlington, MA and at MACOM in Lowell, MA. At SLS Fitness, Ms. Sarrouf’s passion for developing unique experience fitness programming offers people of all ages and fitness levels many kinds of classes, including Group Fitness, Boxing, MMA, Yoga, Meditation, Metabolic Strength and Conditioning, Team Athletic Based Training, Parkinson’s Rock Steady and more. In addition, there are Physical Therapy Specialists, Chiropractic services and café services, specializing in plant based foods, organic protein shakes and supplements. Ms. Sarrouf pioneered the concept of ‘class based’ functional movement. When SLS opened, the concept of having a coach in a group setting was totally new to the fitness industry and it has spread like wildfire. The establishment of an intensive ‘30 minute’ workout coupled with the tenacity to hire the best certified and educated coaches has made SLS one of the top strength and conditioning facilities in New England. In 2009, Ms. Sarrouf traveled to Wake Forest University to train with Metabolic Effect owner, Jade Teta. She then launched the first Metabolic Effect group classes in New England. Metabolic classes exploded at SLS and the demand for the class, by members, is continually increasing almost nine years later. Ms. Sarrouf and the SLS staff was chosen to partner with Lowell General Hospital to be their public educator offering seminars on the importance of fitness. Prior to founding SLS Fitness Ms. Sarrouf’s experience in the strength and conditioning industry spanned 27 years throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Officially incorporated 12 years ago, under the corporate banner of Elite Fitness Professionals, Inc., Ms. Sarrouf provided group fitness management for Gold’s Gyms in Nashua, NH, Merrimack, NH, Manchester, NH and Tewksbury, MA.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art designed to allow the weaker to defeat the stronger. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a perfect fit for women who are interested in learning how to protect themselves and well as work out. We pride ourselves in offering a comprehensive Women’s martial arts program that allows women to become strong, independent and confident. Our Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Program combines a comprehensive self-defense curriculum with emphasis on drills that simulate realistic attack and escape situations. The techniques are complemented by a strong fitness component that is second to none compared to classes offered in regular gyms. Cross Training for Women - Cross Training for Women is not a specialized fitness program, but a deliberate attempt to optimize physical competence in each of 10 recognized fitness domains: cardiovascular and respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy. Cross Training coaches like to point out that even champions in certain sports have huge gaps in their fitness, as defined by the above 10 domains. Ironman competitors score high in some areas, low in others. The marathoner dominates cardio endurance but he isn’t strong. The powerlifter is strong, but often has very low endurance and can’t do a single pull-up. If your goal is to specialize and compete in one sport, then Cross Training isn’t for you. Instead, the goal of the Cross Trainer is to become “competent” in all 10 domains. He may never be a top gymnast but he will develop great body control. He may never win a marathon, but he can enter a 5K without training for it and finish near the top.

In a fun and safe environment, your child will learn valuable self-defense skills enhancing self-confidence leading to excellence in all aspects of life. Ground Control’s Little Champions Program will help your child grow mentally and physically. Ground Control Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provides a challenging, yet safe and caring environment. Children are able to build a foundation that guides them towards become a champion, not just in Martial Arts, but also in life. The outcome of children continuing to practice Ground Control Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu goes far beyond the accomplishments they achieve on the mats. The discipline and excellence taught by our instructors often carries over to the child’s behavior at home, at school and on the playground. There is no losing in jiu-jitsu. You either win or you learn. – Carlos Gracie Jr.";"http://columbia.groundcontrolusa.com/wcs3_class/ladies-jiu-jitsu/";"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is without a doubt the best martial art for a lady to learn in order to defend herself from an attacker. Our ladies jiu-Jitsu techniques are based on leverage rather than strength and physical ability. It is one of the only martial arts where a woman that has been put on he back by a larger and stronger attacker still has the ability to defend herself. Originally developed by the Gracie family, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu promotes the principle that a smaller and weaker person can successfully defend themselves against bigger and stronger opponents using leverage and proper technique. Because of the obvious benefits for women, Ground Control has had many ladies that are interested in learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. However, one of the problems was that the classes tend to be made up of mostly men. Some women were not comfortable getting on the mats with strange men. We fixed that by starting a program that is women only.  This gives ladies the opportunity to begin learning the art in a much more comfortable environment. The new student will spend their first few months of training learning the basic fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Building a good foundation is extremely important! Therefore, basic movement, position, and base will be the primary focus of the student at this stage of their training. Ground Control’s philosophy is that the students Jiu-Jitsu will only be as strong as the foundation that it is built upon in the beginning. Students will experience results that go beyond gains in strength, flexibility, fitness or self-defense skills. By remaining truthful to the lessons learned in practice and applying them off the mats, Ground Control students experience an overall improvement on their focus, energy and general well-being. The Ground Control Ladies Program teaches the basic principles of effective Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to the average woman while showing her how to use this in a real-life situation.";"MMA, Muay Thai, Boxing, No-Gi Grappling, Conditioning Class";;"https://gcc.cshape.net/GuestInfo.aspx";;"JP Ferreira";;"info@groundcontrolusa.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GroundControlColumbia";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvdieTksdZRPBHsYwRgPS2w";"https://youtu.be/kIj-lvwsBz0";;0;699;

You've come to the right place! Since 1990, Ju-Jitsu Dojo of Columbia has provided Japanese ju-jitsu-based, practical self-defense training to men and women from all walks of life. Current and former students consistently remark that the type and quality of training we provide is very difficult to find. If you want to learn how to: avoid threatening situations; respond to lower-level threats; defend yourself against a wide variety of armed and unarmed attacks. Come train with us. No prior experience is required. Individuals of all sizes and ages, including those with disabilities, train here - so can you! In addition to learning to protect yourself, the way we train will increase your: endurance, strength, coordination, cardiovascular fitness. We also offer youth classes, where our younger students develop situational awareness and learn the fundamentals of self-protection. Good values and character development are also an integral part of our training program. ";"https://www.combatju-jitsu.com/images/logo.gif";"https://www.combatju-jitsu.com/youth.htm";"Even in the youth (ages 6-13) classes, our students learn traditional jujitsu. We make the classes fun, but expect a certain level of focus and dedication from the students. Age is not necessarily an indicator, as each child is different; some students (of any age) have the focus, some do not. The best way to find out is to bring your child and have them try a class! That way you and we can see how the child does, and mutually decide whether they're ready to join yet. On the personal side, students in the youth classes learn: respect for self and others, focus, self-discipline, confidence. They also learn: the fundamentals of self protection; situational awareness; coordination; body and spatial awareness; how to roll and fall safely; proper form for punches and kicks; Japanese terms and concepts. We do not spar, and students under the age of 18 are not eligible to earn a black belt. As they advance, they will become eligible to join the juniors class. The youth in our classes quickly learn that size is not an issue in performing techniques. What we teach does not need size or strength to perform, because it takes advantage of the way the human body is built. The students particularly enjoy being able to make techniques work on someone several times their size! Parents are always welcome to watch our classes, and to discuss our program with the other parents whose children attend. Enrollments are ongoing, so you can join at any time of the month. ";"http://www.combatju-jitsu.com/women.htm";"Beginning in July 2012, Ju-Jitsu Dojo of Columbia is offering women-only (ages 14 and up) classes. This separate program covers the same curriculum as the mixed classes, and is taught by the dojo's senior female instructor. Why do we offer them? We recognize that some women are not initially comfortable training with men. If you are one, this gives you the opportunity to concentrate on learning the techniques while dealing with someone of the same gender being in your space. Attendance at these classes does not allow attendance at any of the other classes, but you may transition to the regular classes at any time, as you become comfortable with the techniques. We encourage you to do so, as it will enable you to develop the skills to be able to deal with the psychological pressure of a male attacker, and to explore how to make the techniques work on individuals who are larger and/or heavier than you. Regardless of in which classes you train, you will find the same friendly, supportive environment which has always been one of the hallmarks of our dojo. We do not spar or compete.

In an era of increased bullying, your child will learn how to avoid and effectively defend themselves in dangerous situations. 2. Your child will gain confidence in life which will help them to excel and succeed in everything they take on. 3. Your child will learn respect and common courtesy. These are the first 2 ingredients in child safety and behavior. 4. Martial Arts keeps your child active and helps them to develop a healthy and fit lifestyle. 5. Martial Arts is for everyone! It is not a team consisting of all the best athletes. No one sits on the bench. 6. Your child will learn Self-Control. Self-Control helps children to be patient and gentle in intense situations rather than angry and aggressive. This is an important aspect for handling any emergency situation! While it is also important that a child knows how to be aggressive in certain situations, it should be a choice and not an out of control reaction! 7. Your child will develop lasting relationships with good people. We provide a positive community for your children to become part of. There are so many ways Martial Arts can benefit your child and even your whole family. The list goes on and on. The best way to find out is to bring them in and see for yourself!

Nothing can be more comforting than to choke a possible assailant. Wouldn't these be enough reasons for stepping in the mats? But wait, there's more. BJJ is about friendship and respect as much as it is about self defense. You can be the positive role model for the younger girls while they get to learn and respect others. From our personal experience we have seen that the friendship between the jiujiteiras is stronger than most friendship created in gyms. BJJ training is the most effective self defense martial arts in the world, and perfect martial arts for kids, teens and women. We have an extensive woman's program that continues to grow.

BJJ teaches you to protect yourself. It offers self defense and helps you get in shape while having fun. In the United States, in every nine seconds, a woman is assaulted or beaten which makes Jiu Jitsu a recommended form of self defense. Nothing can be more comforting than to choke a possible assailant. Wouldn't these be enough reasons for stepping in the mats? But wait, there's more. BJJ is about friendship and respect as much as it is about self defense. You can be the positive role model for the younger girls while they get to learn and respect others. From our personal experience we have seen that the friendship between the jiujiteiras is stronger than most friendship created in gyms. BJJ training is the most effective self defense martial arts in the world, and perfect martial arts for kids, teens and women. We have an extensive woman's program that continues to grow.

"Fenix Brazilian Jiu Jitsu South Shore";"http://www.fenixsouthshorebjj.com/";(781) 341-6299;"49 Rose St.";"Stoughton";"MA";"02072";;"United States";"Brazilian jiu-jitsu is a martial art, combat sport, and a self defense system that focuses on ground fighting. Its origins stem from the ground work in judo. Master Mitsuyo Maeda taught judo to a select few in Brazil, one of these people being Carlos Gracie, who then passed his knowledge to brother Hélio, who gradually developed a softer, pragmatic adaptation from judo known as Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ). A common misconception we hear people say is that they are interested in training BJJ but they want to get in shape first. By training BJJ you will get in shape, become more flexible, stronger, and more in-tune with your body and your mind, more so than whatever else it was you were originally going to do to get in shape. The training involved teaches you to persevere and overcome adversity every time you practice. It teaches you about self control, and relaxation in tense situations. BJJ is a great outlet to meet people, make friends, and build relationships. It brings people from all different walks of life together where you could have a high school kid, a doctor, a businessman and a family man all training together. You can have people from all across the spectrum who would never cross paths any other way, and you see this in BJJ more than other martial arts because of the connection you make with people, sharing techniques and friendships.";;"http://www.maxxtrainingcenter.com/class/maxxmonsters/";"BJJ (The Gentle Art) is not about beating someone up or ""choking"" them. BJJ is about overcoming obstacles that seem bigger than you are through self-discipline, perseverance, character, respect, hard work and the will to never give up. Every student gets good at BJJ, just not at the same time. Progression in BJJ is not measured by how big and bad someone is, or how many people a student can tap or beat. We reward students based on their discipline, respect, determination, commitment and focus ON AND OFF the mats. Being good at Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or “fighting” is just a byproduct of the life skills and traits that are forged on the mats during training. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a great way to help kids learn valuable life skills because the things that it takes to get good at Jiu-Jitsu are the very same things that it takes to be successful in life, such as self-discipline, focus, self-respect, empathy and courtesy for others, etc. The way students react under stressful situations (i.e.: someone trying to hold you down on the ground or take you down and choke you out) during training translates to real life situations. A student who panics during these sessions usually has a hard time keeping their composure at the face of adversity off the mats as well. A student who stays calm during these sessions are more likely to keep their composure during times of frustration and pressure. Our weekly practices provide a dynamic controlled mix of physical and intellectual skills, interaction with other children, and the opportunity to learn to lose and win with honor and respect for one another. This variety of experiences offers plenty of opportunities for life lessons to be taught and learned. The inner strength and confidence that come from successfully handling adversity are the foundation to accomplishing many of the larger goals in life. Knowing you can do it, is an advantage that will last a lifetime. By completing the vigorous training sessions, students become empowered as they progress through their rank. They are equipped with real life skills to defend themselves not only physically but mentally as well; ultimately becoming Bully-Proofed to the all the “Bully’s” that life throws at them.";;;"Muay Thai, MMA, Fitness";;;;"Eduardo Nascimento";"1 Week Unlimited Trial Week $20/One-Time";;"https://www.facebook.com/fenixsouthshore/";"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuTsYYU9BGkDDk3LQEBWooA";"https://youtu.be/9OGZqnaBq2w";;1;;

Jiu-Jitsu can help your child with CONFIDENCE! - Jiu-Jitsu focuses on individual achievement, where all kids are included, no one is ""benched"" or forced to ""sit out"" like traditional competitive sports. 2. Jiu-Jitsu helps kids with GOALS - Kids learn to work hard and try their best to achieve their next belt or belt stripe, at NSBJJ our belt grading is based on individual achievement and behavior in and out of the Academy. We also follow guidelines for minimum requirements set by the IBJJF (International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation). 3. Jiu-Jitsu teaches kids practical and proven SELF-DEFENSE! - Jiu-Jitsu or ""Gentle Way"" is a traditional Self-Defense art with origins dating all the way back to Japan where it was used in hand to hand combat by the Samurai! How cool is that? We teach kids how to use leverage and technique to control an attacker or Bully, without needing to hurt another child (Bully) however, kids are taught to use excessive force only if threatened with real physical harm. 4. At NSBJJ we teach kids BULLY DEFENSE! - We believe giving kids the confidence to stand up verbally (what we call verbal Jiu-Jitsu) can usually deter a possible bullying situation. Using self-confidence, direct eye contact and a firm voice first and foremost usually lets the Bully know your kid isn't going to accept being bullied! However there will be situations where a Bully may physically attack your child, and don't worry! They will be ready to defend themselves when this does happen! 5. FITNESS! - We do lots of age appropriate fun games with the kids, and lots of exercise! Jiu-Jitsu is a very physical Martial Art, so we make sure kids learn proper movements and body control using Jiu-Jitsu specific warm ups and exercises. 6. FRIENDS! - We pride ourselves at NSBJJ in having a friendly and welcoming environment. We reward and praise kids for helping out each other and helping out the younger and newer kids. There is no competition allowed with one another because we are all one team and here to make each other better! 7. FUN! - Lets face it Mom and Dad, if your kid isn't having fun, they aren't going to want to come to Jiu-Jitsu. Although it can't all be fun and games and they will need to focus and learn the moves, we do it in a fun way, with no pressure. We understand kids do not all learn the same, and we know how to let kids work at their own pace, but always making sure they are trying their best! We also have fun game nights, movie nights and the ever popular ""Parents Night Out"" where we entertain your kids so you can relax, or have a night out on the town!

K I Salem MA sets itself apart from other programs through the quality of our instruction and focus on the overall development of our students. The lessons our students learn in class extend beyond self defense to all aspects of life. Along with developing better fitness, our students develop a healthy sense of self confidence and discipline that help them achieve any goal they set for themselves. Though many lessons are common to all martial arts, we feel it is important that the nature of each martial art style remain unique. Unlike other programs that try to “blend” different styles into a new system, our classes keep different martial arts separated into their native styles. This is done for several reasons: 1) Out of respect for the history of each style, we seek to preserve the rich traditions that each style has to offer. 2) Each of our instructors has extensive experience in his or her style. Students receive higher quality training through focused attention from an experienced teacher. 3) Different students have different interests. Our offerings allow each student to train in what he or she is interested in. Of course, many people today are interested in martial arts because of the popularity of Mixed Martial Arts. If you look at top MMA fighters, they generally hold a black belt in one martial art and receive additional training in other styles to complement their main interest. We believe this is the best way for anyone interested in MMA to train. As a result, anyone interested in MMA is expected to train in one of our other programs. Our students come from a variety of ages, backgrounds, interests, and levels of ability.

Whether you are interested in learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for self-defense or to test your skills competitively you will like Jiu-Jitsu USA. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a mixed martial art, combat sport, and self-defense system that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting. BJJ promotes confidence in the individual to stand in the face of adversity.  With the proper training, anyone can learn to take the fight to the ground. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self-defense. Sparring (commonly referred to as ""rolling"") and live drilling play a major role in training. Here we teach both street Jiu-Jitsu and competition Jiu-Jitsu. You will learn to focus your energy and develop your technique, leverage, joint locks, and chokeholds into expert maneuvers.  Whether you have little to no experience or are an accomplished MMA fighter, you will find our classes challenging. Please visit us at our facility in Charlton. It is a clean, well-kept building conveniently located on Route 20. Come try out our brand new competition mats from Fuji.

By approaching the art of BJJ in this way we find that success follows naturally. Our uniqueness lies not only in our unmatched unity and spirit, but also as a result of our students and instructors progressing in their pursuit of BJJ excellence exclusively through the Kimura way from the very beginning of their BJJ journey. Our philosophy of advancement in rank from novice to master only from within allows us to maintain a standard of excellence and authenticity that would otherwise be unattainable.

Statistics show that every day in the U.S. as many as 150,000 kids miss school due to fear or intimidation from bullies. It is widely believed that bullying is one of the leading causes of low self-esteem in children. Making matters worse is the fact that most victims of bullying don’t report it or talk about it. Bullies are typically insecure individuals who harass smaller, weaker children to boost their own sense of self-esteem and ego.";"http://www.kimurabjj.com/women-self-defense/";"Women choose to train in martial arts for a variety of reasons: Fitness, stress reduction, a sense of empowerment, and competition, to name just a few. However, learning self-defense is by far the most common reason women choose to train in martial arts. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is almost tailor-made for women as a method of self-defense, as it was developed from its origin to neutralize any advantage of power, size, or strength. At Kimura BJJ USA, we find that having males and females train together in the same classes offers our female students the advantage of gaining very real and practical experience in actually applying what they learn in scenarios that replicate threats they might encounter from would-be attackers in real life. Simply put: There are no better self-defense classes available for women than Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Because it is based around the concept of using leverage and technique as opposed to speed and strength, it builds necessary functional power and is perfect for any body type. Our program teaches effective self-defense techniques that help our students deal with situations involving: bullies, aggressive kids, strangers, and other potential dangers. Team Maryland supplements our program with a strong family community, where students can meet friends and develop important life skills such as: teamwork, respect, confidence and commitment!

Our women's self-defense program teaches women to defend themselves using techniques based on leverage and natural body movements. Unlike other ""self defense"" programs, which emphasize violent techniques such as biting, eye gouging, scratching, and groin shots, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu uses armlocks, holds, and other submission techniques. When using Gracie Jiu-Jitsu properly, a much smaller person can defend themselves against a larger attacker. Having to rely on mace, pepper spray, car keys, or any weapon you may not carry all the time will leave you at a disadvantage. Learning self defense is much different than training to be a fighter.

This age group won’t usually face the same kinds of more complex bullying issues that older children may experience. In this class, the goal is to have FUN and begin building the student’s confidence in themselves. Positional control and self-defense is taught though a series of jiu jitsu based “Gracie Games” which will teach the child how to be comfortable in a physical situation, and avoid being hurt by another child who is behaving aggressively. From the first time the students start learning jiu jitsu, they also begin to learn when and how it is to be used. That’s where the Character Development Program comes in! A portion of every class is dedicated to discussion about possible scenarios that children may encounter in their daily lives, and how they can incorporate character-building principles. Discussions cover such topics as Health, Respect, Citizenship, Internet Safety, Strangers, and many others. ";"http://www.berwynheightsbjj.com/woman-empowered-class.aspx";"Women Empowered® is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 15-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 20 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents.

We started out with just 3 classes a week. These classes were held at a place called “Universal Gymnastics” right off of Best Gate Road, across the street from the Annapolis Mall. The classes/styles taught were Muay Thai Kickboxing, Brazilian “Gracie” Jiu Jitsu and Wrestling. We combined these styles into our brand of Mixed Martial Arts. The goal was to offer a wide variety of martial arts styles in order for students to become as well rounded as possible. In the beginning we made due with what we had and got the most out of our training in that gymnastics studio. Over time We started to grow little by little and pretty soon Ivey League MMA needed it’s own building to call home. We moved Ivey League right up the street from Annapolis to Severna Park, behind the bowling alley on Ritchie Hwy. It was at that point when we moved to Severna Park we launched our children’s program which quickly grew into one of the biggest programs in all of Maryland. After a few years we ended up out growing that location too. From there we moved to our current location in Arnold, inside the YWCA building. We’ve been inside the YWCA for almost 3 years now. Many of the students who started with us back at the gymnastics center are still here today training with us. It’s crazy how far we’ve come and we’ve very appreciative for all the wonderful people we’ve been able to work with and help over the years.

Our Mission:  To create a training environment of mutual respect between martial disciplines and provide a place where students can experience a variety of teaching approaches and training methodologies for the betterment of their lives through self-defense, fitness, and holistic health practices. Our Name: Kogen is a term coined by Ellis Amdur as a way of expressing the potential synergy of classical and modern martial traditions when practiced with the correct focus and respect. The Japanese prefix ‘ko’ (古)  refers to something old or ancient, as in koryu (古流) or kobudo (古武道), ancient or classical martial traditions. The Japanese prefix ‘gen’ (現) refers to something in the present with gendai (現代) meaning modern, as in genryu (現流) or gendai budo (現代武道), modern martial traditions. Kogen Dojo (古現道場) is a place where both classical and modern martial traditions are trained and taught with mutual respect, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Our Story: Kogen Dojo was formed as an ideal, out of necessity. A group of martial artists from diverse training backgrounds were discussing the fact that there were no local academies that offered and embraced both traditional and modern martial arts in a way that encouraged people to immerse themselves in both, finding benefits in each. The founders of Kogen Dojo wanted to create a space where they themselves would want to train, a space where respect and effectiveness were all that mattered. Combining their experiences, with a common purpose, Kogen Dojo was formed. At Kogen Dojo, students can train and cross-train in Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai Kickboxing, Taikykoku Budo (Japanese Jujutsu) and Taikyoku Kiko (qigong), each art offering its own unique but complimentary perspective on self defense and unarmed combat.";"https://i1.wp.com/kogendojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-03-05-06.32.42.png?resize=300%2C129&ssl=1";"https://kogendojo.com/index.php/kidsjiujitsu/";"Every month, three million children miss school because they fear bullies. Maryland’s zero tolerance policy, which prohibits students from defending themselves in school, has put our children and us parents in a very difficult position. Not only are kids afraid of bullies, getting beaten up or harrassed, but they are also afraid of the consequences of standing up for themselves. They are stuck between bullies and the system. At Kogen Dojo, an affiliate of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Maryland, we teach our young students to first attempt to verbally de-escalate a violent situation, giving them specific and direct phrases for dealing with bullies. If verbal de-escalation is not successful, our kids are taught to then tell an adult about the bullying behavior. The self defense skills we teach them are the last resort when all non-violent have been tried and have been unsuccessful. The ability to not have to fight is true power and our main goal is to empower the children that we teach. Patience, Tolerance, and Discipline are definining characteristics of a good Martial Artist. We teach our children that a real Martial Artist is Respecful and Humble, never someone who looks for fights or picks on others. Sometimes, sadly, the fight picks you and you are left with no option besides Self Defense. What sets Kogen Dojo apart as a Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Maryland affiliate is that we teach these values to our kids as well as the skills necessary to defend themselves when absolutely necessary. We are the only Martial Art School in Anne Arundel County that focuses on all aspects of Self Defense, from fight avoidance, to conflict de-escalation, and finally how to neutralize an attacker as needed.";"https://kogendojo.com/index.php/womens-self-defense/";"No Experience Necessary!

In order to advance to the next level, or earn the next armband, students must pass a physical fitness test and successfully complete a technique demonstration.

The outcome of children continuing to practice Ground Control Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu goes far beyond the accomplishments they achieve on the mats. The discipline and excellence taught by our instructors often carries over to the child’s behavior at home, at school and on the playground. There is no losing in jiu-jitsu. You either win or you learn. – Carlos Gracie Jr.";"http://groundcontrolom.com/wcs3_class/womens-only-jiu-jitsu/";"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is without a doubt the best martial art for a lady to learn in order to defend herself from an attacker. Our ladies jiu-Jitsu techniques are based on leverage rather than strength and physical ability. It is one of the only martial arts where a woman that has been put on he back by a larger and stronger attacker still has the ability to defend herself. Originally developed by the Gracie family, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu promotes the principle that a smaller and weaker person can successfully defend themselves against bigger and stronger opponents using leverage and proper technique. Because of the obvious benefits for women, Ground Control has had many ladies that are interested in learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. However, one of the problems was that the classes tend to be made up of mostly men. Some women were not comfortable getting on the mats with strange men. We fixed that by starting a program that is women only.  This gives ladies the opportunity to begin learning the art in a much more comfortable environment. The new student will spend their first few months of training learning the basic fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Building a good foundation is extremely important! Therefore, basic movement, position, and base will be the primary focus of the student at this stage of their training. Ground Control’s philosophy is that the students Jiu-Jitsu will only be as strong as the foundation that it is built upon in the beginning. Students will experience results that go beyond gains in strength, flexibility, fitness or self-defense skills. By remaining truthful to the lessons learned in practice and applying them off the mats, Ground Control students experience an overall improvement on their focus, energy and general well-being. The Ground Control Ladies Program teaches the basic principles of effective Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to the average woman while showing her how to use this in a real-life situation.";"MMA, Muay Thai / Kickboxing, Boxing";;"http://groundcontrolom.com/schedule/";"Mon, Wed: 6:00am-7:00am, 6:00pm-9:00pm; Tues: 11:30am-9:00pm; Thurs: 5:00pm-9:00pm; Fri: 6:00am-8:00pm; Sat: 10:00am-12:00pm; Sun: 10:00am-11:30pm";"Ryan Mackin";;"mackin.ryan@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GroundControl-Owings-Mills-919962388084523/";"https://www.youtube.com/user/GroundControlOM";"https://youtu.be/RL_7023uK1U";;1;;
