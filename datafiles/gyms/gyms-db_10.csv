He is a 6th Degree Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt - the highest ranked Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt in Alberta and among the highest ranked in Canada. Born in Petrópolis, Rio de Janiero, Brazil, a small town in the southeast region of Brazil, his love for jiu jitsu started at the age of 14 when he met mentor and teacher, Aloisio Silva. After receiving his blue belt when he was 15 years old, he moved to Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro with Aloisio Silva to join Aloisio's ""Team Dojo"". As a young determined athlete, he spent countless hours at the gym with Aloisio and trained 2-3 times every day. With intense perseverance and training, he obtained his black belt from Aloisio Silva at the age of 20. Anderson's lineage can be traced down to the Gracie line, in that, Aloisio Silva received his black belt under Master Carlos Robson Gracie, son of Carlos Gracie. In 1999, Anderson moved to Orange County, California with Aloisio and had the great honor of finding a master of life who became a dear friend and mentor, Master Joe Moreira. Master Joe Moreira is an 8th degree Coral Red and White belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, 3rd degree Black Belt in Judo, a former UFC veteran, and the current President of the United States Federation of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Under the tutelage of Master Joe Moreira, Anderson became part of Team Punishment, training world-renowned former UFC champions such as Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson and Tito Ortiz. Master Moreira's rank is an admirable one, as it is received by one of only 6 Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Red Belts in the world, Master Francisco Mansor. Master Mansor was awarded his Red Belt (9th degree) by the Father of Jiu Jitsu himself, the late Grand Master Helio Gracie. Anderson then moved to Calgary, Alberta, and opened the doors to AG Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 2005. The rest is history! He continues to train the highest-level champions on both the local and international BJJ championship scenes, as well at the most reputable and sought-out MMA shows. Anderson continues to bring Master Moreira to Calgary on a regular basis and receives his mentorship to this day - a friendship that has now blossomed to that of family, much like our gym atmosphere.";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5e1000_30da016e22404318b8f6cb8a7e78d5a1~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_100,h_102,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/21314858_1566661656729745_67278752571143.jpg";"https://www.agbjj.com/brazilian-jiu-jitsu";"This class focuses on the fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and self defense.

Our Women’s Only Class provides an opportunity for women of all experience levels to improve with each other. With regular practice and proper execution, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu allows a smaller individual to gain a significant advantage when pinned by a much larger individual. BJJ teaches a person to remain calm by eventually rewriting the body’s natural reactions to uncomfortable situations, developing an innate ability to handle an attack. Additionally, BJJ teaches mindfulness, given the state of alert the body is in during drills and sparring sessions. Without knowing it, BJJ students offer each other a powerful, affirming, accepting, and biologically-mediated experience simply through the body-to-body contact that occurs. Such contact triggers the release of neurochemicals in our brain and hormones throughout our body, making us more aware, focused, and connected. One of the things that distinguishes BJJ from other martial arts is that from day one, the first time you step on the mat, you are grappling face-to-face with other students. While drills and techniques are critical to your development as a BJJ student, students must pit themselves against other students from the first class.

He is a 6th Degree Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt - the highest ranked Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt in Alberta and among the highest ranked in Canada. Born in Petrópolis, Rio de Janiero, Brazil, a small town in the southeast region of Brazil, his love for jiu jitsu started at the age of 14 when he met mentor and teacher, Aloisio Silva. After receiving his blue belt when he was 15 years old, he moved to Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro with Aloisio Silva to join Aloisio's ""Team Dojo"". As a young determined athlete, he spent countless hours at the gym with Aloisio and trained 2-3 times every day. With intense perseverance and training, he obtained his black belt from Aloisio Silva at the age of 20. Anderson's lineage can be traced down to the Gracie line, in that, Aloisio Silva received his black belt under Master Carlos Robson Gracie, son of Carlos Gracie. In 1999, Anderson moved to Orange County, California with Aloisio and had the great honor of finding a master of life who became a dear friend and mentor, Master Joe Moreira. Master Joe Moreira is an 8th degree Coral Red and White belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, 3rd degree Black Belt in Judo, a former UFC veteran, and the current President of the United States Federation of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Under the tutelage of Master Joe Moreira, Anderson became part of Team Punishment, training world-renowned former UFC champions such as Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson and Tito Ortiz. Master Moreira's rank is an admirable one, as it is received by one of only 6 Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Red Belts in the world, Master Francisco Mansor. Master Mansor was awarded his Red Belt (9th degree) by the Father of Jiu Jitsu himself, the late Grand Master Helio Gracie. Anderson then moved to Calgary, Alberta, and opened the doors to AG Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 2005. The rest is history! He continues to train the highest-level champions on both the local and international BJJ championship scenes, as well at the most reputable and sought-out MMA shows. Anderson continues to bring Master Moreira to Calgary on a regular basis and receives his mentorship to this day - a friendship that has now blossomed to that of family, much like our gym atmosphere.";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5e1000_30da016e22404318b8f6cb8a7e78d5a1~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_100,h_102,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/21314858_1566661656729745_67278752571143.jpg";"https://www.agbjj.com/brazilian-jiu-jitsu";"This class focuses on the fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and self defense for children ages 4-8.

One significant difference that most parents notice right away is that jiu-jitsu is a ""grappling"" art. Meaning, jiu-jitsu techniques focus on taking an aggressor to the ground, and then stopping their attack with a pin or hold. This may seem like an ineffective strategy to the untrained person, but it's actually incredibly effective. And, it's great self-defense training for kids. In other arts, the only options a child might have are strikes and kicks. But in jiu-jitsu, kids are trained to control an attacker and then neutralize their attack using the least amount of force necessary. This approach works great for kids, because they don't have to hurt another kid to defend themselves. Most kids are hesitant to throw a punch, and for good reason. But with jiu-jitsu, they can defend themselves without reservation, because they know they can do so without injuring the other child.";;;;;"http://submissionartsacademy.com/179-2/";;"Spencer Lalonde";"10 days free";"info@submissionartsacademy.com";"https://www.facebook.com/SubmissionArtsAcademy";"https://www.youtube.com/@submissionartsacademy436";"https://youtu.be/YKyE-6MIOEU";"https://www.instagram.com/submissionartsacademy/";;0;3738;;;"CA";4942;

"Evolution BJJ Petawawa";"http://www.evolutionbjjpetawawa.com/";;"57 Festubert Blvd., Building P-118";"Petawawa";"ON";"K8H 2X3";;"Canada";"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu emphasizes getting an opponent to the ground in order to utilize ground fighting techniques and submission holds involving joint-locks and chokeholds. The premise is that most of the advantage of a larger, stronger opponent comes from superior reach and more powerful strikes, both of which are somewhat negated when grappling on the ground. A more precise way of describing this would be to say that on the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced by an experienced grappler who knows how to maximize force using mechanical strength instead of pure physical strength. BJJ is most strongly differentiated from other grappling arts by its greater emphasis on groundwork. Commonly, striking-based styles spend almost no time on groundwork. Even other grappling arts tend to spend much more time on the standing phase of a fight. Sport BJJ’s focus on submissions without the use of strikes while training allows practitioners to practice at full speed and with full power, resembling the effort used in a real fight or competition. Training methods include technique drills in which techniques are practiced against a non-resisting partner; isolation sparring, commonly referred to as positional drilling, where only a certain technique or sets of techniques are used, and full sparring in which each opponent tries to submit their opponent using any legal technique. As a result, BJJ practitioners’ physical conditioning is also a very important part of their daily training regime.";"http://www.evolutionbjjpetawawa.com/uploads/4/5/2/6/45266453/gym-bag-design_orig.jpg";"http://www.evolutionbjjpetawawa.com/bjj-youth-programs.html";"Little Warriors (Age 5-6) - This class is for children ages 5 to 6 years old and is designed to give them a head start in BJJ by using interactive games to teach basic techniques and concepts. This class will facilitate an easier transition for students to the Youth BJJ classes. Young Warriors Beginner (Age 7-14) - This class is for youth ages 7 -14 years old who are new to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The class is designed to introduce the students to the basic techniques and concepts of BJJ. It is designed to help kids build self-confidence, respect, courage, discipline, sportsmanship, concentration and coordination. The techniques taught allow a smaller, weaker person to defend themselves against a larger, stronger opponent through the use of leverage and angles. Our instructors teach effective self-defence while making each class challenging, technical and fun. Through martial arts your child will develop skills that will last him/her for a lifetime. Young Warriors Intermediate (Age 7-14) - This class is also for youth ages 7 – 14 who have already been introduced to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and have a strong understanding of the basic techniques. Instruction is designed to further develop the basic techniques while adding more to the students’ knowledge base. This class is used as a “bridge” between the Beginner and the Advance classes in order to prepare them for the more complex techniques that are taught in the Advance Class. Students remain in this class until the Jr. Yellow is achieved. Students in this class typically are still wearing a white belt (but achieved stripes) or a grey belt. Young Warriors Advanced (Age 7-14) - This class is for youth ages 7 – 14 years old who have obtained their Jr. Yellow Belt or higher. It is the next step in building upon the techniques and discipline learned in the Beginner and Intermediate Young Warriors Programs. More advanced techniques will be taught with a review of the basics, including a specific component focused upon tournament preparation.";;;"Muay Thai";;"http://www.evolutionbjjpetawawa.com/schedule.html";;"Steven Burgess";;"evolutionbjjpetawawa@hotmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/evolutionbjjpetawawa";"https://www.youtube.com/@petawawajiujitsu/";"https://youtu.be/JGitRS71Cpo";"https://www.instagram.com/evolutionbjjpetawawa/";;0;3879;;;"CA";;

In our society, it is important for us to acknowledge the reality faced by our children everyday. Unfortunately, we cannot solely rely on our school systems to ensure that kids are protected from bullying, physical and verbal abuse from negative social networks. Obeisity and inactivity (eg. excessive video game playing - no exercise whatsoever), among other physical and social challenges leads to an erosion of their confidence. Although some extracurricular activities might provide our children with an outlet for physical expression and development, they are sometimes too competitive to give a healthy balance, or sometimes too narrow and superficial to help gauge and develop emotional wellbeing in our kids. There must be something deeper, something more meaningful to help our kids to conquer their fears and achieve their goals.

La principale différence, c’est que lorsque que vous vous entraînez avec gi, cela vous permet de saisir celui de votre adversaire, par exemple par le col ou la manche et de l’utiliser à votre avantage pour le soumettre. Ces prises vous permettent d’avoir un meilleur contrôle lors du combat et aident un combattant moins imposant physiquement à en contrôler un plus costaud. Dans un cours sans gi, vous n’avez plus la possibilité de saisir les vêtements, il est donc plus difficile de contrôler votre adversaire. Au cœur du jiu jitsu brésilien, il y a la conviction qu’une personne plus petite et plus faible peut vaincre un assaillant plus grand et plus fort. Contrairement à la majorité des arts martiaux qui privilégient le combat debout avec les pieds et les poings, le jiu-jitsu brésilien se focalise sur le combat au sol, domaine extrêmement technique où la taille et le poids ont moins d’importance.

Ce que la plupart des gens ne savent pas, c'est que le jiu-jitsu vous permettra également d'appliquer ces mêmes principes dans les combats quotidiens de la vie, comme la perte de poids, l'ennui, le stress, les problèmes relationnels et la confiance en soi. Vous apprendrez à réfléchir aux problèmes de manière plus constructive qu'auparavant, sur et hors des tapis. Chez Gracie Barra Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, vous faites partie d'une famille élargie. Vous rejoindrez une équipe qui vous soutiendra dans votre quête d'amélioration personnelle. En vous entraînant aux techniques et en participant à des séances d'entraînement en direct, avec vos partenaires et vos entraîneurs, vous disposerez d'un arsenal d'armes en cas de besoin. Plus vous vous entraînerez au jiu-jitsu, plus vous vous armerez de connaissances et de compétences pour mener tous vos combats dans la vie comme une ceinture noire.";"https://gbsainteanne.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo_round.png";"https://gbsainteanne.ca/fr/class/kidsteens/";"Pour exceller dans toute entreprise, les individus doivent avoir un ensemble de valeurs solides et un caractère bien trempé qui leur donne la persévérance nécessaire pour atteindre leurs objectifs. Le programme Gracie Barra Kids a été créé pour offrir aux enfants de 3 à 14 ans un environnement qui leur permet de faire l'expérience et de comprendre des valeurs fondamentales comme la concentration, la discipline, la persévérance, la coopération et le respect.

En tant que sport de contact, le jiu-jitsu brésilien Gracie Barra offre un environnement très stimulant, mais sûr et attentionné, qui permet à l'enfant de mûrir pour devenir un champion dans la vie réelle. Le résultat de la pratique continue du BJJ pendant l'enfance va bien au-delà des réalisations sur les tapis. La discipline et l'excellence exigées par nos instructeurs se répercutent souvent sur le comportement de l'enfant à la maison et à l'école. Notre programme de Kids Jiu Jitsu est typiquement subdivisé en 4 groupes différents afin d'accueillir des élèves d'âges et de niveaux de compétences variés: Petit champion (3-6 ans), 1 GBK (6-7 ans), 2 GBK (7-10 ans), 3 GBK (11-14 ans).";"https://gbsainteanne.ca/fr/class/women-program/";"Gracie Barra propose un programme d'autodéfense amusant, agréable et préparé professionnellement, exclusivement pour les femmes.

Nous vous apprendrons d'abord à les prévenir, puis nous vous donnerons la formation nécessaire pour y répondre efficacement! Votre professeur Gracie Barra, entièrement certifié, vous enseignera plusieurs techniques différentes, dont chacune pourrait vous sauver la vie en cas de tentative d'agression sexuelle.

Over time, mostly through word of mouth, class sizes continued to grow. Team Ross then went from being a small club into a full time fitness & combat sports gym that is one of the most recognizable and successful gyms in the Southeast. Though Team Ross has grown, we have maintained the same small gym community atmosphere that we believe separates us from the rest. In 2018, Team Ross joined the Maverick Training Center Atos Jiu-Jitsu Huntsville Alabama.

However, our program is very safe and closely monitored by our coaching team, and we truly believe Jiu-Jitsu prepares children to face and overcome uncomfortable situations by applying the critical thinking skills the art provides. Jiu-Jitsu mostly takes place on the ground. There are no strikes involved, so both children and adults are able to more readily practice the moves and techniques they learn in class with partners. During training, children get the chance to “live” grapple and try and submit their classmates using the chokes and joint locks they learn. Sometimes this makes a child uncomfortable. Usually after only a few classes, though, they learn that just being in a position of discomfort isn’t a reason to panic or give up. As we train them to defend each of the positions in the program, children learn to remain calm, breathe, focus, and look for solutions, as well as build upon what they've learned to constantly improve.";;;;;"https://www.florencebjj.com/programs";;"Michael Mann";;"florencebjjacademy@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/FlorenceBrazilianJiuJitsu/";;;"https://www.instagram.com/florencebjj/";;0;1650;;;"US";;

No simulated methodology or pretend air punching – BJJ requires assignment of a training partner because you simply can’t learn on yourself. Kids must learn respect and how to get along with others so that they can practice the techniques properly. Kids learn to focus and develop problem solving skills. Confidence and an enormous sense of pride comes as they develop the physical skills required for proficiency in BJJ. And by contrast, BJJ is also an exceptional method for teaching kids modesty, grace, peacefulness and humility through the requirement to recognize, acknowledge and concede submission or defeat. All kids classes are taught by Suzanne Ramsden, Maverick Training Center founder and 3rd degree Black Belt. Every class includes assistant coaches to ensure each student receives personalized instruction and individualized attention. All types of adolescent personalities are represented here, and all participants gain from the physical, emotional and mental benefits of BJJ - shy kids, outgoing kids, kids that have experienced bullying and extraordinarily athletic kids too. We also sponsor a successful Kids Competition Team that travels around the southeast for tournament competitions. Classes begin at age 4 and students are provided with an official BJJ ranking.

Deciding to train in a martial arts program can be scary and cause you to consider giving up before you ever really get started.  My family and I experienced the same fears and questions many years ago when we began our journey.  We have been blessed in our martial arts career to train directly under the founder of our Taekwondo system Grandmaster Man Hee Han and have the privilege and opportunity to learn the style, techniques and philosophies directly from him and his son Master Yujin Han. When I started studying martial arts my daughters and eventually my wife joined with me. We have some of our most memorable trips and adventures because of this journey that we started and share together. We learn together, practicing at home together, and preparing each other for belt tests and competitions. There are a lot of families in our martial arts organization that study and train together. I would have never dreamed that all these years later I would be a Master Instructor and operate Academies teaching others martial arts and encouraging men, women and entire families to begin the same journey I began so many years before.  Many years after beginning my training with Grandmaster Han I was looking to diversify my training and add more opportunities in our Academy.  It was at this time that I was blessed for the second time in my training career.  I began training in Gracie Jiu-Jitsu under Grandmaster Rorion Gracie and his two sons Professors Ryron and Rener who are the son and grandsons of the creator of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, Grandmaster Helio Gracie. To say that I have been blessed and fortunate to train under two of the greatest martial arts families in history would be an understatement.

Taiho-Ryu is an American-based martial arts system developed by Fleming (Bo) Hardy, 10th degree black belt, in the early 1970's. Elements from many martial arts systems, including jujitsu, Isshin-Ryu, Shotokan, and Taekwondo have influenced the development of Taiho-Ryu. Drawing heavily from Taiho-Jutsu, a jujitsu style used by the Japanese police forces, the system blends these elements into an effective style of self defense, with the emphasis on practicality, rather than sport. Although apparent goals may be to improve and develop martial arts abilities, the intrinsic goal in Taiho-Ryu is actually one of personal development on an individual basis.";;;;;;;;"https://www.taiho-ryu.org/schools.html";;;;;;;;;;0;104;;;"US";;

Our mission is “To Empower Today’s Youth to Become Tomorrow’s Leaders.” Our programs are infused with life skills that will prepare our students for the inevitable challenges that will come their way.

A few things Lil’ Dragons will learn: to follow instructions, take turns, act respectfully, problem solve, show self-control, socialization, build fundamental motor skills, increase their focus ability and promote stamina and coordination. We encourage our parents to be patient and not compare their child to others. As our students stay faithful to attending class twice a week and practicing at home, they will improve and suddenly become “the focused one” everyone on the bench is pointing out.

It is a unique style of no gi Brazilian Jiu Jitsu which was made to work both inside the cage and on the sporting mats. The intentionality behind the creation was to have an unorthodox style which could keep an opponent under constant control and in the threat of danger. The 10th Planet system was put to the test in Abu Dhabi 2003, and it succeeded masterfully by facilitating Eddie Bravo's victory over long time reigning champion Royler Gracie. Immediately following that victory, Eddie opened his own school to further the system. What separates 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu from other styles is its innovation and evolution. Some of the moves, like the Rubber Guard, the Twister, and the Lock-Down have taken the Jiu Jitsu community by storm because of their originality and effectiveness. The moves mentioned here are so different that opponents do not know how to react to them and they leave the practitioner in a unique position to execute with little to no defense from their opponent. Moreover, the beauty of the system does not stop there: Eddie and his students are constantly inventing new moves and counters to old moves in order to keep the style relevant and functioning. So, where other systems cease to grow, 10th Planet finds itself in a situation where its entire focus is to continue its own growth.";;;"Our 10th Planet Kids class' intention is to instill self-confidence and increase self-esteem in your child while learning the basics of self defense from a wrestling and jiu jitsu standpoint.

It focuses on gaining a dominant position over your opponent with the help of techniques such as chokeholds, joint-locks, compression lock, etc. Most martial arts need the practitioners to be physically strong to face a heavy-weight opponent. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu needs more of body mechanisms rather than strength, speed and weight of the person practicing it. They can therefore be used effectively by anyone of any age, size, strength or level of physical fitness. A common way for men to win a fight over women is to knock her down to the ground and control the whole situation.

Kids will learn concepts and movements that will set the foundation for their journey as martial artists. Equally important, classes emphasize learning strategies, which are proven methods to help kids learn at an accelerated rate. Equipped with a basic formula for controlling/submitting their opponents, kids will actively problem solve while receiving real resistance from their training partners. The 101 class provides a fun environment for kids to ‘play’, while the game they’re playing translates directly into skills they can use for self defense or grappling tournaments. Kids will leave class having been stimulated mentally, socially and physically. They will learn what they can achieve through disciplined practice and will experience real growth in their confidence, learning ability, sociability and physicality as a result of being a young martial artist at Island Top Team. KID'S BJJ 201 - The all levels advanced class accepts students who wish to take their training to the next level. Building off the fundamentals curriculum, kids will be challenged to a greater degree. They will learn advanced techniques with enhanced detail, their learning will be more self-directed and the sparring will prove to be a greater challenge. Kids in the 201 program have shown a consistent interest in their growth as a 101 student and are rewarded with entry into the 201 program. Disciplined kids with a willingness to learn and the appropriate physical dexterity will be invited to the 201 as early as a few months into their training. Kids in the 201 program are also permitted to compete at grappling tournaments if they choose, and we provide coaching at tournaments inclusive of the program. Kids are not expected to compete and will not be compelled to do so, but those who wish to will be given the tools necessary to succeed.";"https://jaypagesjjmma.com/classes/";"This is our fundamentals martial arts class, open to all students.

You will learn how to achieve, control and transition between these positions using the building block movements of BJJ that are frequently neglected or taught incorrectly. You will learn the skills of guard retention, sweeping, sweep recovery, and guard passing.

Both warm-up styles not only provide cardiovascular exercise, but they teach some of the physical skills required to perform BJJ techniques. All instruction is done in an age-appropriate way. Students watch the demonstration and then try the technique with their partner. After the Professors show technique, the kids get to roll with each other in timed matches. This is usually their favorite part of class. Often children of equal size and ability are paired with each other during matches, but not always. When a beginner goes against a seasoned kid, they really challenge themselves by working as hard as they can to submit their more experienced peer. The older kids are very aware of their strength and take care not hurt the younger kids. Children are always welcome to watch a class before they decide to participate. You have a free week trial period to see how your child does. We have loaner kimonos to borrow for the trial period.";;;"No-Gi Grappling, Combatives";"12 Month Adult Membership $100 per month; 12 Month KIDS Membership $90 per month; 6 Month Adult Membership $125 per month; 6 Month KIDS Membership $120 per month; M to M Adult Membership $150 per month; M to M Kids Membership $140 per month; Drop In Rate $15 Per Day; Family of 3 Membership $250 per month - 12 Month Membership; Family of 3 Membership $300 per month - 6 Month Membership; Family of 3 Membership $350 per month - Month to Month; Family of 4+ Membership $300 per month - 12 Month Membership; Family of 4+ Membership $350 per month - 6 Month Membership; Family of 4+ Membership $400 per month - Month to Month; Paid in Full Membership $350 per person 3 Month Membership; Paid in Full Membership $650 per person 6 Month Membership; Paid in Full Membership $1050 per person 12 Month Membership";"https://www.nsbjj.com/weekly-schedule";;"Sean Alexander Huff";"One Week of FREE Training";"huffsean@gmail.com";;;;"https://www.instagram.com/nsbjj/";;0;1694;;;"US";;

That mission is the preservation of Grand Master Helio Gracie’s beloved art of self-defense, his teachings, and the Jiu Jitsu way of life. We dedicate ourselves to street awareness, not points. Knowing how to survive in a dangerous situation, protecting our kids from being bullied as well as acquiring balance within our life is our goal. If you are in the market for street self-defense, bully proofing your child, life style change or just want to try something new please come give us a shot.";"https://www.graciejjav.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Gracie-Jiu-Jitsu-Apple-Valley.svg";"https://www.graciejjav.com/self-defense-training-classes/";"GRACIE BULLYPROOF® - This program is designed by the Gracie’s to teach children the beginning stages of Combatives, how to deal with bullies and how to have some fun. This program consists of 10 Gracie games that kids absolutely love! Each game has movements that build the foundation to the Combatives techniques. They will also learn “The Rules of Engagement.” This is important so that every student knows when and when not to use the techniques they have learned. Many children even after learning the techniques featured in GRACIE BULLYPROOF®, will not take a stand against bullies. Fear of punishment, from school administrators and from parents, is so strong, that most children will do nothing in response to persistent verbal or physical harassment from a bully. By teaching your child the Rules of Engagement, not only will you ensure that they do not abuse their power, but you will give them a step-by-step plan to follow any time they are targeted by a bully and the assurance that you will support them in the event that they are compelled to stand up for themselves. Upon completion of Gracie Bullyproof® your child will be allowed into Jr. Combatives where they will focus deeper by learning 33 techniques that pave the way to the Combatives Program.";"https://www.graciejjav.com/self-defense-training-classes/";"WOMEN EMPOWERED® - Women Empowered is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 10-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 15 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to pink belt! Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the perfect self-defense system for women, but only if it is taught correctly. If you’re unsure about learning BJJ for fear of injury, embarrassment, or any other reason, then the Women Empowered program is perfect for you! If you’ve tried BJJ at another school and had a negative experience, give Women Empowered a chance, and we guarantee it will win you back to the mat!";;;"https://www.graciejjav.com/book-your-class/";;"Jonny Vasquez";"10 Day Free Trial";"graciejjav@yahoo.com";"https://www.facebook.com/people/Gracie-Jiu-Jitsu-Apple-Valley/100063662316435/";"https://www.youtube.com/@graciejiujitsuapplevalleyt1801/";"https://youtu.be/P2SxCSlySrY";"https://www.instagram.com/graciejiujitsuapplevalley/";;0;1782;;"Team Inner Strength";"US";;

"Brea Jiu-Jitsu";"https://breajiujitsu.com/";(714) 267-7668;"379 W. Central Ave";"Brea";"CA";92821;;"United States";"Dan “TrumpetDan” Lukehart is the owner and head instructor at Brea Jiu-Jitsu. Dan has been training Jiu-Jitsu since January of 2006 and is a black belt under Beneil Dariush since 2013. Many in the Jiu-Jitsu community are aware of Coach Dan through an instructional series he released on YouTube in 2010 that incorporated a then novel approach of reverse engineering a competitor and teaching it in a systematic lesson based format. Through the videos, he developed a niche early for having an analytic based approach to learning. As this niche was developing and evolving he received an invitation to be the commentator for the IBJJF World Championships, IBJJF No-Gi World Championships, IBJJF Pan Championships and IBJJF Masters Worlds during the BudoVideos era. Coach Dan can be heard in all the biggest matches of this time period. He pushed the boundaries by making a conscious decision to include more rules based and strategic commentary in an era where this was very controversial. In 2014, he partnered with BudoVideos to produce a top selling instructional on the closed guard – The Science of The Closed Guard. In 2015 he launched JiuJitsu.net, an innovative website incorporating the latest learning theories from which to learn Jiu-Jitsu online. This website graphed all of Jiu-Jitsu via nodes and edges and innovated in a number of different areas. With Jiu-Jitsu properly graphed in this manner, different learning algorithms could be used to present the information in customizable curricula with different visualizations of the options present at each phase. Through the JiuJitsu.net banner, Coach Dan ran a series of then uncommon prize money tournaments with high quality live streams. These tournaments broke new ground and were designed to showcase to the world what young talented competitors were capable of in mixed belt, mixed aged tournaments. In the worlds first true open tournament (any weight, any belt, any age), it was the 13-15 year old teens who dominated, not the seasoned brown and black belts which sent ripples through the community and changed the perception of the talent contained in the juvenile divisions. When Brea Jiu-Jitsu opened in 2012, Coach Dan was committed to doing things differently. One aspect of that was to open the doors to athletes from any school/affiliation regardless of BJJ politics. Over the course of the past decade, this reputation has grown, particularly in Brazil, Europe and Australia. Many regularly stay at Brea Jiu-Jitsu for both brief and extended periods and become regular faces at the gym. Many have gone on to become the biggest names in BJJ and visit often. This environment benefits all. Coach Dan has produced from scratch those that have medaled in the adult division of IBJJF Pans, IBJJF Worlds, IBJJF Masters Worlds and IBJJF No Gi Worlds. While his online reputation is of that of an analytic based approach, only through a combination of analysis and tough training can you achieve success at this level. Coach Dan’s students also regularly test themselves and local tournaments such as NABJJF, JJWL, Dream and others. Dan has a rich background with the city of Brea having grown up in Country Hills Estates and attended Olinda Elementary, Brea Jr. High and Brea High School. He has worked developing, teaching and supervising after school band and enrichment programs under Creative Brain Learning and served as Brea Olinda Unified School District’s elementary school band director.";;"https://breajiujitsu.com/kids/";"Brea Jiu-Jitsu’s Kids and Juniors program is designed for the young practitioner to excel at the gentle art.

In the Gracie Bullyproof® program, our goal is to instill your child with unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof® program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 12. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof® techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof® classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof® program is for you! Even if your child has previously tried Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and had a negative experience, we can assure you that they will absolutely love the Gracie Bullyproof® program!";"https://graciejiujitsufullerton.com/women-empowered";"Women Empowered® is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 15-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 20 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered® lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered® program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered® program, you may test for promotion to Pink belt! Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the perfect self-defense system for women, but only if it is taught correctly. If you’re unsure about learning BJJ for fear of injury, embarrassment, or any other reason, then the Women Empowered® program is perfect for you! If you’ve tried BJJ at another school and had a negative experience, give Women Empowered® a chance, and we guarantee it will win you back to the mat!";;;;;"Jake Warren";;"GracieJiujitsuFullerton@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GracieJiuJitsuBrea/";;"https://youtu.be/0gDDuWehsZc";"https://www.instagram.com/graciejiujitsu_fullerton/";;0;1776;;;"US";;

Striking also won’t likely be an option once you’re on the ground, where a rapist/attacker is most likely to assault a woman. But most assailants have no training to fight on the ground, and that’s where Gracie Jiu Jitsu gives you the greatest advantage. Learn to create leverage for escapes, as well as submissions to subdue your attacker - regardless of size. Jiu Jitsu is also one of the most complete forms of exercise.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu’s power comes from its scientific approach to self defense.";;;;;"https://sektorbjj.com/classes-schedule";;"Sean Roberts";;"info@SektorBJJ.com";"https://www.facebook.com/SektorBJJ/";"https://www.youtube.com/@Seanrobertsbjj";"https://youtu.be/Tw86oxU9fBI";"https://www.instagram.com/sektorbjj/";"Sean Roberts - 2018 American National Champion (black belt); 2015 Sport Jiu-Jitsu Absolute World Champion (Black Belt); 2016 Sport Jiu-Jitsu Middleweight World Champion (Black Belt); 4X World Champion Medalist; 4X North American Champion; 3X American National Champion; 4X Grapplers Quest Advanced Champion; 2007 No-Gi World Champion; 2011 Grapplers Quest Absolute Champion; 2011 American National Absolute Champion; 2011 US Open Champion; 2012 San Francisco Open Absolute Champion; 2012 BJJ Kumite (Reality Series for Top Brown Belts Around the World); 2013 Budovideos PPV Seminar with Kurt Osiander; 2012/13 Featured in Gracie Magazine and Jiu-Jitsu Magazine; 2013 KO Finisher Superfight winner in two black belt superfights; 2014 Metamoris Competitor (Sean Roberts vs. Zak Maxwell); 2014 UFC Fan Expo Grapplers Quest Gold Medalist; 2015 NABJJF All Americas Champion (Black Belt)";0;306;;;"US";;

After careful planning and training, we initiated our kid’s program in 2003. Our kid’s program is fun and exciting! Children learn the technical components of the most effective self-defense system, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and learn to apply that knowledge in a positive, welcoming, and safe environment. At Boran Jiu-jitsu we look forward to becoming part of your family. Our kid’s program was developed to provide children ages 4-15 with an environment that allows students to develop and experience important core values like confidence, focus, commitment, discipline, respect, and a lifetime habit of fitness. As children grow and develop in their knowledge of jiu-jitsu techniques, they learn to apply the other core values to their lives with the help of their COACHES/MENTORS. We at Boran realize that this is a time commitment for parents, but we are sure that you will find it definitely worth the time and effort as parents will notice these values carry over into their behavior and values both at home and at school. Students also enjoy the competition side of jiu-jitsu by participating in local tournaments with their peers and mentors.

Founded in 2008 by Master Vieira, Checkmat now has affiliate academies in thirty-four American cities and sixteen countries worldwide. With its headquarters in Signal Hill, Long Beach, it is an ideal location for our students, who plan on competing on the world stage, to go and participate in the competition camps.

We empower children to feel confident in their ability to be physically active and have techniques to deal with bullying. According to Make Beats, Not Beat Downs, every 7 minutes a child is bullied, each day 160,000 students miss school for fear of being bullied, and 1 out of 10 students drop out of school because of repeated bulling. Your children will learn techniques that can help them defend themselves against punches, a person holding them down, putting a person on the ground to get away, getting a person off their back, and submissions such as chokes and joint locks. Nevertheless, Jiu Jitsu is called the gentle art because it allows an opponent to tap when that person wants to stop fighting. Your children will learn to protect themselves and counter act according to what another person does. This is one of the reasons Jiu Jitsu is so dynamic. Its ever-changing options mimic situations they may encounter outside the academy and gives them the confidence to defend themselves. Jiu Jitsu does not have kicks, punches, or prearranged movements that can be tested. In addition, if your child wants to earn a black belt then he or she will be studying Jiu Jitsu for many years. People can only be awarded a black belt when they are 19 years or older. We follow the International Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation, IBJJF, recommendations. Between the ages 4-15, your children can earn up to 13 belts. The last belt for children is Green and Black. After this belt and the age 16, your children will start the adult belt sequence. Please come and have your children try one of two classes we offer for children: Pee Wee ages 4-9, Youth 10-15.

In the women’s class, ladies will understand the technical aspects of BJJ which helps them adapt the martial art to their body using movement, balance, and leverage. The ladies will learn BJJ concepts: What they are, how they work, and how they can be utilized for self-defense.

Once you complete the Women Empowered® program, you may test for promotion to pink belt!";"Striking, Fitness Kickboxing";;"https://hbutc.com/Home/Schedule";;"Tiki Ghosn";;"info@hbutc.com";"https://www.facebook.com/hbutc";"https://www.youtube.com/@HBUltimateTC/";"https://youtu.be/9PzCKSJ8TOI";"https://www.instagram.com/hbutc/";;0;1898;;;"US";;

We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus!

This allows the students to learn in a fun way while developing their coordination and reflexes. Our instructors are trained to always keep the children motivated and at the same time disciplined. Another thing that sets our Little Spartan Program apart from other kids Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu programs is that we regularly have not just one or two coaches per class… but three to four coaches per class instead! Little Spartans have developing minds that need personal attention. By having more qualified coaches on the mat at the same time it will guarantee to maximize each of our students learning experience. Spartan Champions Program (10-15 Years Old) - Bullying is most prevalent in this age group. We focus our program on basic self-defense techniques that will help our students defend themselves from any situation that may arise including confrontation-avoidance dialogues. We often have class discussions about bullies and what to do in specific situations. In the Spartan Champions Program our students also start to spar on a regular basis. After learning the moves, sparring is the most important part of their progression. Sparring works their reflexes in real time situations and is the closest thing to defending themselves against an attacker in real life. Children who maintain a steady training schedule are allowed to enter Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitions. Courage, Self Control, Respect, Discipline, while at the same time having fun! In the DMBJJ Spartan Champions program your child’s concentration, coordination and fitness level will also increase. Our program also focuses on improving children’s listening and motor skills. These skills will help them enter society with more confidence and enthusiasm. There are eight major skills our instructors focus on when training children ages four to fifteen. Those skills are: focus, teamwork, control, balance, memory, discipline, fitness and coordination. In each class we cover at least one of these skills with a wide variety of activities that are fun and at the same time educational. All skills are taught in a safe and supervised environment. Our instructors, programs, curriculums, and methods of teaching have earned 5 stars reviews from all of our DMBJJ parents! The martial art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a great educational gift for you to give to your children.";"https://www.dmbrazilianjiujitsu.com/womens-program/";"Ever thought about trying women’s self defense or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?

At Cortez Full Circle Martial Arts, we feel that the best way to ensure that you are not a victim of violence is by learning self-defense. Wrestling is one of the most important skill-sets required in combat sports today because it has the ability to control where the battle goes. Knowing how to wrestle could very easily help anyone in a situation of self-defense. Along with the physical benefits of wrestling, it has the ability to teach young athletes personal responsibility.

"Meraki BJJ";"https://www.merakijiujitsu.com/";(310) 968-5474;"11652 W. Olympic Blvd";"Los Angeles";"CA";90064;;"United States";"Meraki was co-founded in 2017 by Jason, who was the principal driver of the vision for what Meraki would become. Jason's journey started with training Judo as a youth in Texas, obtaining a black belt in 1999. That led him to discover Jiu Jitsu, which he started in the late 90s under Carlos Machado in Texas. Parallel to Jiu Jitsu, Jason started a career at Vidal Sassoon that ultimately took him to become the creative director for the iconic global luxury hairdresser out of Los Angeles. At the same time, Jason continued to evolve his Jiu Jitsu through training with Jean Jacques Machado, Romulo Barral, Lucas Leite, and others in the area through 2007. That year, Jason decided to dedicate himself fully to Jiu Jitsu, quit his role at Vidal Sassoon, and moved to Brazil to train as the only American in a small team under Ramon Lemos, one of the most renowned coaches in the sport. That team comprised an unparalleled group of world champions, whose innovative approach would usher in a new era of modern Jiu Jitsu, including Rafa and Gui Mendes, Andre Galvao, and Gilbert Burns. Jason ultimately received his black belt from Ramon Lemos and remains the only American to have done so to date.  After returning to the US in 2011, Jason emerged as one of the leading coaches at the academy of Romulo Barral, a multiple world champion and one of the most dominant competitors of his time. As a coach, Jason helped guide elite competitors like Gabriel Arges and Edwin Najimi to world championships and other titles. During this period, Jason developed the vision for a new type of Jiu Jitsu brand: a state of the art academy with a sophisticated aesthetic and training culture that would unlock each member's creativity and cultivate a unique community. And thus, Meraki was born in 2017 with a geometric Bauhaus-inspired design and art display that brought Jason's vision to life. In 2021, Meraki moved to its new and more spacious location, which advances the brand vision through a deeper articulation of its Bauhaus roots, combining symmetric shapes and select materials for a cohesive aesthetic that elevates the experience for each member.

We are proud to say we are continuing the legacy of Grandmaster Hélio Gracie who believed jiu-jitsu should empower the weak to be able to defend against the strong. This is why we offer structured martial arts curriculums specific to the self-defense needs for any demographic or skill level, with programs created for beginner adults, women, and children. We take pride in creating a safe, comfortable, and welcoming learning environment for all students and family members in Monterey.

"Marcellini's Martial Arts Academy";"https://riverside-brazilianjiujitsu.com/";(951) 742-5733;"3457 Arlington Ave., Unit 108";"Riverside";"CA";92506;;"United States";"Since 2000, Marcellini’s Martial Arts Academy has been a premier training center known for excellence in the Inland Empire. We pride ourselves in having a safe and effective program that anyone regardless of age, size, or fitness level can benefit from. Our mission is to provide an authentic martial arts program that is conducive to self-awareness and betterment of our students. We work with experts in character development for our children’s program and altercation de-escalation for all ages. Although we teach our students to avoid confrontations, when self-defense becomes necessary it is crucial to have the knowledge and skills to stay safe whether standing in striking range or grappling on the ground. Sam Marcellini shares curriculums, expertise and knowledge from some of the best schools in the world. Sam has an extensive training background with legends in both grappling and striking arts. Although there are many Jiu-Jitsu schools that we consider a part of our family, we find that our training methods and choice of techniques differs a great deal as we focus solely on the self-defense aspect of Jiu-Jitsu rather than sport Jiu-Jitsu. As a young martial arts instructor, Sam started training with Royce Gracie and his father Grandmaster Helio Gracie in 1994 and has been a dedicated part of the team ever since. Royce Gracie’s early victories in the UFC revolutionized the world of martial arts by contributing to a movement towards grappling and ground fighting. As a sparring partner of Royce Gracie and an undefeated fighter himself, Sam Marcellini was the second person ever to receive a black belt from Royce Gracie in California. Sam is also a dedicated student of the original Mejiro gym style of kickboxing, a style that emerged to develop the best strikers in the world. The Mejiro gym style was the first non-Thai school to have success in the brutal and realistic Muay-Thai competitions in Thailand. Mejiro gym is renowned for developing many legendary fighters including Toshio Fujiwara, the first ever non-Thai stadium champion in Thailand, as well as Rob Kaman, a nine-time World Muay-Thai Kickboxing Champion. Sam was the first person ever to become a certified instructor under Rob Kaman in the US. If you are looking for a complete self-defense system, Sam has spent a lifetime studying and blending striking and grappling arts together to achieve just that. His system and instruction hold great value to everyone, from the first-timer to the expert.";"https://riverside-brazilianjiujitsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Marcellini-logo-navbar.png";"https://riverside-brazilianjiujitsu.com/riverside-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-child/";"Sam Marcellini’s program works hand-in hand with a child’s schoolwork. His program develops self-discipline, self confidence, mental alertness, and goal setting skills. At Marcellini’s Martial Arts Academy, young people are taught that through dedicated, intense work, all worthwhile goals in life are possible. Parents have attributed our program with improving their child’s grades as a direct result of the increased motivation, achievement, self-direction, and self confidence provided by the program. Sam Marcellini’s program is vigorously designed in conjunction with education experts to develop high levels of self-defense skill while providing social, physical, emotional and attitudinal growth.";"https://riverside-brazilianjiujitsu.com/riverside-women_selfdefense/";"The driving belief behind the curriculum in this class is that avoiding dangerous situations is always the safest choice, no matter how much experience and training you have. For that reason, an important part of the course is teaching students boundary setting and how to identify the different behavior patterns of sexual predators, both strangers and non-strangers (people the victim already knows). By teaching our students to identify predators and the different stages of an assault, we give our students the tools necessary to avoid and deal with these scenarios. In case physical confrontation becomes inevitable, we also train our students in the use of some of the most effective and devastating techniques from different styles, both standing and on the ground. This seminar usually becomes available with limited enrollment once or twice a year. Although we do our best during the seminar to prepare students to defend themselves against a physical attack, we highly recommend that women also participate in our group Jiu-Jitsu classes at least twice a week for a year for significantly higher effectiveness. Women always have the choice to ONLY work with other females in our Jiu-Jitsu classes if that is what they prefer. The techniques learned in our group Jiu-Jitsu classes will not only make the seminar much more beneficial, but they will also have the amazing benefit of developing truly effective overall self-defense skills. We do offer FREE Assault Prevention Seminars for local places of worship (20 person minimum). And we do conduct Assault Prevention Seminars for local businesses and organizations with a 20-person minimum at $60.00 per person.

With over 350 Luta Livre fights to his credit, and a professional mixed martial arts record of 17 wins under his belt  (including a Middleweight Championship belt), Serao has fought in Brazil’s CVI, MECA, Japan’s SHOOTO, the American IFL, the PFC, and the TPF. In other gyms where students rarely get to train with their professors, Leopoldo uniquely trains with each and every student as much as possible.  This is one of the reasons students come from all over the Bay Area to train at the Serao Academy and also one of the reasons his students show vast improvements in a such a short time, including many of his students already winning and placing in World Championship level Tournaments.

It was created to provide children ages 4-15 with an environment that enables them to participate in and comprehend, values that are central to Jiu Jitsu, like focus, discipline, persistence, teamwork and politeness. As a “gentle” combat sport, Gracie Barra Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provides an exciting, safe and caring environment for children to progress toward the more intricate and higher-level Gracie Barra Northridge adult programs. The result of the long-term practice of Gracie Barra Brazilian Jiu Jitsu goes well beyond achievements on the mats. The self-discipline and excellence encouraged and embodied by our coaches often carries over to other aspects of the child’s life. As an added benefit, kids enrolled in the program are taught practical and easily implemented strategies to help them counteract bullying in school. Gracie Barra kids are much less likely to be bullied because they learn both verbal and non-verbal skills for de-escalating and safely ending situations that might otherwise lead to violence. Of course, they are also taught to safely and effectively defend themselves. Kids learn to focus their attention and exert their energy in a positive way that empowers them to reach their personal goals.  Plus they all get to enjoy the healthy experience of social networking – even if they are new to the area and are in a different school with lots of unfamiliar faces. At Gracie Barra Northridge we pride ourselves on providing a clean, safe, family environment within which each child can grow as both an individual with unique needs and talents and as an important member of our youth team. Our Gracie Barra Future Champions Program is subdivided into three different groups to provide the most appropriate instruction for students of different ages and skill levels: Little Champions I (4-6 years old), Juniors (7-9 years old), Teens (10-15 years old)";"https://www.gbnorthridge.com/classes/womens-self-defense/";"Learn the fundamentals of Gracie Barra Jiu Jitsu from 8-time world champion Romulo Barral!

It is estimated that as many as 160,000 children stay home from school on any given day in fear of bullying or harassment. And a shocking 85% of bullying is never intervened. Martial arts for kids has been proven time and time again to be one of the most effective ways to increase your child’s confidence and provide them with the physical and mental strength to overcome life’s challenges, starting with bullies. With his own three daughters in mind, Javier developed a youth program that focuses on vital skills and characteristics for the empowerment and development of children. In our self defense classes for kids, we provide the most powerful defensive skills so that your child(ren) are prepared and can protect themselves from bullies of any size.

We believe that empowering women with the knowledge and confidence that it takes to know that they can defend themselves against a male attacker could transform them forever. We discuss how simple awareness could be the difference between being a victim of an attack and avoiding it all together. We discuss how to identify a possible attacker and how to deal with that face to face and physical confrontation that could arise. We also discuss and teach defenses to the most common attack scenarios for women that are attacked by men. Most martial arts will teach women that just punching and kicking is a realistic solution or even an efficient form of self defense. At times, at even more scary rates, women have the belief that hitting an attacker in the groin is a good enough solution to a bad situation. None of these options are reliable and effective. As a matter fact, hitting someone in the groin is possibly the WORST thing that women can do in a real life-threatening situation. Our Jiu-Jitsu classes aren’t only the most effective martial art in the world, but we also have the BEST self defense classes for women because we teach women how to defend themselves by using timing and leverage. This is important because timing and leverage are most effective at empowering a smaller and weaker person against a larger and stronger attacker. Our school is prepared to provide women with an effective strategy, both standing and on the ground, against an attacker who is bigger, stronger, and capable of hitting back.";"Cardio Kickboxing Classes, Law Enforcement Training";;"https://jiujitsuranchocucamonga.com/academy-weekly-schedule/";"Mon, Wed: 5:00am-9:00pm; Tues, Thurs: 10:00am-12:00pm, 5:00pm-9:00pm; Fri: 6:00am-9:00pm; Sat: 10:00am-12:00pm";"Javier Vazquez";;;"https://www.facebook.com/JavierVazquezJiuJitsu/";"https://www.youtube.com/@javiervazquezjiujitsuranch7865/";"https://youtu.be/JYYuH23rrXM";"https://www.instagram.com/jvjiujitsu/";;0;248;;;"US";;

Jiu-Jitsu training provides students with unrivaled self-defense techniques that have proven to be effective time and time again. Self-defense techniques acquired through Jiu-Jitsu training teaches students the most effective methods to neutralize an opponent, while simultaneously minimizing any harm or damage that may occur. Jiu-Jitsu teaches techniques that do not require a tremendous amount of energy, with the goal of tiring your opponent to the point of disadvantage. The lessons and techniques learned through Jiu-Jitsu are priceless and can ultimately save your life. Jiu-Jitsu training involves a tremendous amount of movement within a brief amount of time. Conditioning drills increase your cardiovascular fitness, while grappling incorporates your body’s largest muscle systems. For example, maneuvering your opponent requires leg strength, abdominal strength and muscular endurance. In a Jiu-Jitsu match, the first person who suffers fatigue finds himself or herself at a disadvantage. After your first few months of training, you will find yourself in the best shape of your life. You will have greater endurance, focus, reduced stress and better sleeping habits thanks to the conditioning you receive at the Charles Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy. Sparring at Charles Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy offers realistic experiences within a safe environment. While sparring is considered dangerous in other sports, such as boxing, it is taught and executed much more mindfully in Jiu-Jitsu. One of the greatest safety measures in sparring in Jiu-Jitsu is the ability for either competitor to tap out at any time. This helps to avoid injury on the mat, and allows the opportunity for participants to regain focus and continue. The participants then resume sparring and attempt to gain the advantage yet again. With the ability to stop at any time, it is extremely difficult to get injured during sparring. You can focus on learning the moves at your own pace with help from knowledgeable sparring partners. At the Charles Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy, you can learn the moves without injury. By choosing the Charles Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy, you are giving back to your community by supporting a locally-owned business. You will make new friends in your classes, and together, you will discover and enjoy a new hobby and lifestyle. As your relationships with your classmates develop and bonds are strengthened, your training will become more meaningful to the class as a whole, as support, encouragement and celebration of each other’s achievements become more personal.

Eddie Bravo was a student of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) legend Jean-Jacques Machado, and he started to develop his own approach to BJJ that focused on techniques and strategies that were outside the traditional BJJ curriculum. The name ""10th Planet"" comes from the idea that the system is a parallel universe to traditional BJJ, with its own unique set of techniques and principles. The system is based on a ""no-gi"" approach, which means that it is designed for grappling without the use of a traditional uniform or gi. 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu has gained a reputation as a highly effective system for MMA and submission grappling competitions. It has also become popular among recreational grapplers and fitness enthusiasts who are looking for a challenging and innovative way to train. The system has spread around the world, with many 10th Planet-affiliated gyms and instructors teaching the system in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia.";"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/518715_4f14624ad0504a4486e96b82fea82bc7~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_199,h_197,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/10privnobackgroundlogo.png";"https://www.10thplanetjjriverside.com/classes";"Kids Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu offers a multitude of benefits for young practitioners.

The history of Cassio’s Sacramento location dates back to 1996 when Cassio came to the U.S. for the first time. Cassio stayed for a few months and opened a training center with the help of Terry Maxwell. Cassio returned several times to compete, give seminars, and teach at the school and was eventually invited to come and coach full time at an academy in Sacramento (Kovar’s Karate). Cassio and his wife Hilza made Sacramento their home in 2003 and opened his own academy in 2005. Cassio’s instruction has attracted both beginners and professionals alike. As a World Champion and highly regarded BJJ Instructor in Sacramento, many elite athletes such as Randy Couture, Urijah Faber, Dan Henderson, and Frank Mir have trained with Cassio when they need to work on their ground game. Today, many of the BJJ Black Belts teaching in the greater Sacramento area received their belts from Cassio! Cassio brings passion to his instruction and enjoys sharing authentic Brazilian Jiu-jitsu with his students, whether they aspire to be a champion, to challenge themselves or just stay in shape. If you ask a student that trains at Werneck Jiu-jitsu, and they’ll tell you it’s like training with family. Cassio’s students come from all walks of life, but on the mat, we’re all students of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. We help each other and push our fellow students to become better at Jiu Jitsu and life. Cassio is a true leader; and takes care of his students.";"http://cassiowerneck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CassioLogo_white-letters.png";"http://cassiowerneck.com/kids-jiu-jitsu/";"Our kids jiu jitsu students are taught to use their fighting skills for defense and protection only.

Our schools, Instructors, and competitors are present not only in the United States or Brazil, but also in South and Central Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Founded in 1986, Gracie Barra grew to become renowned in the Martial Arts world. Unyielding commitment to excellence on teaching methods, cutting-edge programs, and focus on a balanced life style for our members, along with a bountiful collection of Championship titles, GB is considered by many the power house of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Each one of the over 500 Schools spread worldwide has the mission of teaching Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as a means for individual development going beyond the contest philosophy. When asked, “What does Gracie Barra mean to you?” All of our students would have the same answer: A family. That is not fortuity. It is rather the result of life works of extraordinary individuals like count Mitsuyo Maeda, Carlos Gracie Sr., Rolls Gracie, Carlos Gracie Jr., and GB Instructors who dedicate their lives to the realization of their dreams, and to the continuity of their predecessors’ legacies. The Gracie Barra School of San Diego was founded in May 2016. Our school is the result of the effort of Prof. Alexandre Ogawa, a world Class Black Belt Gracie Barra team member. We offer world-class level Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instruction for individuals, families, and Law Enforcement officials of San Diego and is a reference for fitness, character development, self-defense, martial art, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training for the community of San Diego. Gracie Barra is for anyone who values discipline, wellness, martial art, respect, and is looking for a well-balanced life-style. It doesn’t matter if you are a person with no training background that wants to lose weight or learn self-defense, a busy business man looking for a stress relieving activity, a parent searching for an something to complement the education of your kids, or an experienced martial artist aiming for the further development of your fighting skills, come to the school. We are sure you will find at our school an exciting and challenging place that will allow you to achieve your goals.";"https://www.graciebarrasandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cropped-logo-e1525675902344-1.png";"https://www.graciebarrasandiego.com/programs/kidsprogram/";"To excel in any endeavor, individuals need to have a strong set of values and a solid character that gives them perseverance to achieve his or her goals. The Gracie Barra Future Champions Program was created to provide children ages 4-15 with an environment that allows them to experience and understand core values like focus, discipline, persistence, cooperation and respect. As a contact sport, Gracie Barra Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provides a very challenging yet safe and caring environment for a child to mature towards a real life champion.The outcome of continued childhood practice of GB BJJ goes far beyond the accomplishments on the mats. The discipline and excellence demanded by our instructors often carries over to the child’s behavior at home and at school.";"https://www.graciebarrasandiego.com/programs/womens-program/";"Aside from all classes offered in the Adults Gracie Barra Program Structure, our school offers a set of classes designed to introduce women to the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. As a martial art designed to allow the weaker to defeat the stronger, BJJ is a perfect fit for women who are interested in learning how to protect themselves? and who wouldn't be, right? The Gracie Barra Women’s Program combines a comprehensive self-defense curriculum with emphasis on drills that simulate realistic attack and escape situations. The techniques are complemented by a strong fitness component that is second to none compared to classes offered in regular gyms. Classes specially designed for women like Rape Prevention, BJJ Conditioning and social get togethers are added benefits to the ordinary GB activities and create a strong bond between the members of the Gracie Barra Pink Team.";;;"https://www.graciebarrasandiego.com/class-schedule/";;"Alexandre Ogawa";;;"https://www.facebook.com/graciebarrasandiego/";"https://www.youtube.com/@graciebarrasandiego/";"https://youtu.be/L5UfGCZNynU";"https://www.instagram.com/gb_sandiego/";;0;1832;;;"US";;

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a self-defense system that enables the people who practice it to defend themselves by using leverage to submit opponents. This is done without throwing punches or kicks. Using our proven techniques your child will be able to defend themselves from bullies even though we do not teach them how to strike. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a fantastic way to promote an active and healthy lifestyle for kids of any ages. Parents of our students often find that their children gain self-esteem through athletic achievement and learn how to carry themselves better in situations that require them to deal with pressure. If your son or daughter is acting overly aggressive in school, lacks focus and or discipline then we at Gracie San Diego recommend you start them out with a private lesson to introduce them to the sport and class structure. They will learn that Commitment, Respect, Focus, Self-Discipline and effort always make a rewarding experience and bring positive results. Besides self defense skills that will give children a high degree of self confidence.  Our Kids and Juniors programs will also work on: Developing listening, obedience and focusing skills; Improving social skills; Improving self-control, respect and discipline; Increasing physical attributes such as hand-eye coordination, strength, agility and flexibility. What makes Gracie Jiu-Jitsu so effective for kids is the fact that instead of learning moves through katas or prearranged set of movements carried out on a cooperative training partner, they will learn how to apply grappling techniques on a resisting training partner who’s not cooperating and is counteracting with his own moves, much like as what you’d see on the streets.";;;;;"https://www.lebrejiujitsu.com/schedule";"Mon-Fri: 7:00am-8:00am, 12:00pm-1:00pm; Sat: 11:00am-12:00pm";"Regis Lebre";;"info@thegraciesandiego.com";"https://www.facebook.com/graciehumaitasd/";"https://www.youtube.com/@regislebrejiujitsu1399";"https://youtu.be/-uNmbh_Txcw";"https://www.instagram.com/lebre_jiujitsu/";"Regis Lebre - Rio de Janeiro State Championship Titles 1st place – 1998, 1999, 2000; Brazilian Nationals Championship Titles 3rd place – 1998, 1999, 2000; World Championship Titles 1st place – 2007 (Master Division); 2nd place – 2008 ; 3rd place – 1999; Gracie World Championship (Columbus-OH)1st place – 2007; Brazilian Nationals Team Championship 2nd place – 1999; Brazilian Regional North and Northeast Championship 1st Place – 1997, 199;  Pan American Championship 1st place – 2009 2nd place – 2007 (Open Class); 3rd Place – 2005, 2007";0;158;;;"US";;

A group of artists & Punks asked Jimmy Friedman AKA; ""Jim Bone"" to teach them self-defense shortly after the violent murder of a loved one. Classes began in the shadow of tragedy, and Aikido in a small way helped heal the suffering these people were going through. Beginning as a club for that group of around ten friends, the dojo soon outgrew the Sixth Street studio and relocated to 759 Harrison Street in San francisco, California where it remained for three years. In 1989 we moved to 57B Stillman Street were we remained until 1999. In 1999 we moved to 141 11th Street. Since 1986 the Dojo has hosted many of the world's highest ranking Aikido instructors, including Kato Hiroshi Sensei, Christian Tissier Sensei, Nishio Sensei, Anno Sensei, P. Hendricks Sensei, Sugawara Sensei, Terry Dobson Sensei, K. Cottier Sensei. After the 1989, San Franicisco earthquake, James moved the dojo a few blocks away to 57 Stillman Street, and it stayed at that location for ten years. In 1995 Kato Hiroshi Sensei was welcomed to San Francisco, and shortly thereafter ""Skidrow Dojo"" was renamed Suginami Akikai SF.

"Ralph Gracie San Francisco";"https://www.ralphgracie.com/";(415) 552-4777;"1166 Howard St";"San Francisco";"CA";94103;"5/5 Stars";"United States";"Ralph Gracie, a member of the renowned Gracie family, has made significant contributions to martial arts, particularly Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). Born into a family that revolutionized martial arts, Ralph Gracie was destined to leave his mark. He was trained by his uncles Carlos and Helio Gracie, the patriarchs of the Gracie family who were instrumental in the creation and popularization of Vale Tudo and mixed martial arts (MMA).Ralph Gracie embraced the family’s unique fighting style, a blend of Jiu-Jitsu with elements of Judo, wrestling, and boxing. This style, known as “Gracie Jiu-Jitsu,” emphasized leverage, superior positioning, and ground fighting techniques, allowing a smaller or weaker person to defend against a larger or stronger opponent.Ralph Gracie’s influence in martial arts extends beyond his own accomplishments as a fighter. He has been a dedicated teacher, sharing the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu techniques with students in his academies in California. His commitment to teaching has helped to spread the Gracie style of Jiu-Jitsu across the United States and beyond. Ralph Gracie’s contributions to martial arts also include his participation in Vale Tudo and MMA competitions. His performances in these no-holds-barred fights showcased the effectiveness of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and helped to popularize these sports globally. The Gracie family’s involvement in the creation of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in the early 1990s brought unprecedented attention to Jiu-Jitsu. Ralph Gracie, like his family members, demonstrated the dominance of their fighting style in the UFC, further promoting the sport. Today, Ralph Gracie’s contributions to martial arts, particularly Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are widely recognized. His dedication to teaching and his success in competitions have helped to shape the landscape of martial arts. Ralph Gracie’s legacy, like that of the Gracie family, is a testament to the philosophy that skill, strategy, and discipline triumph over sheer physical strength.

In our program your child will be able to progress at their very own pace. We understand that everyone learns differently. Whether your child can only train once a week or everyday we have the program that will fit your needs. Everyday, approximately 150,000 kids miss school due to fear or intimidation of bullies. Unfortunately, this is happening to children as young as kindergarten age. Not only can bullying lead to low confidence and self-esteem issues, but it also causes children to dislike school at one of the most impressionable times in their lives. Can you imagine how it would feel to go to work every single day and be afraid for your own safety and well being? Many kids have that same feeling while going to school every day. How can we expect children to focus well on their academics when they are under such stress? While parents may expect the teachers to intervene, the increasing statistics in bullying over the years is a clear sign that school administration is not or cannot resolve the problem. You can absolutely do something to stop or prevent this from happening to your child. Give your child the ability to stand up for him or herself. Bullies prey on those who they perceive as weak. Training martial arts can give your child the real confidence to hold their head up high and not act like someone who is an easy target. In a vast majority of situations, that aura of confidence alone will cause bullies to stay away.";;"The Smash Gyms Women's Self-defense and Martial Arts program includes krav Maga, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, and fitness classes! Women can take beginner friendly classes six days a week! Our classes will help you build the skills and confidence to protect yourself in any self-defense situation! Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is actually more important for women to know than a man in a self-defense situation! When a woman is attacked typically the attacker isn't trying to box or kickbox her. An attacker will typically grab a woman and attempt to manhandle and control her until he is in a dominant position. Our Jiu-jitsu program is the ideal solution for that type of situation. self defense jiu jitsu Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is a grappling based martial arts that utilizes specific techniques designed to control bigger, stronger opponents. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu students learn how to use their large muscle groups to isolate, control and attack the small muscle groups and vulnerable areas of a resisting opponent. Students will improve their physical fitness, problem solving ability, and self-knowledge of their body and mind. The Smash Gyms Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructors have strong focus on safety at all times.

He gets down on the mats at their level and shows them first hand how to do the techniques. His commanding presence helps even the most ""easily distracted' child learn to pay attention, be respectful and help their teammates. Our Academy offers several levels of classes for kids as young as 3 years old, through teens, beginners to competition level classes. The current students, especially the older, more experienced students, are taught how to ""roll"" with new kids, and will quickly help them adjust to the full contact sport. In a matter of weeks your child will feel like part of a big family. Many of our students have been with us since we opened doors, and now compete at the international level for our fight team. Classes begin with a line-up, by rank, from senior belts to newest. We bow to show our respect to our Professor and coaches, and then we warm-up together. Next, Professor demonstrates the techniques we will be learning and pairs the kids up with similar size partners to do practice drills. After water break we come back to do more practice with resistance from our partners, and finally move on to ""real sparring"" under the watchful eye of professor and his adult, high ranking coaches. The classes then have a little fun, playing dodge ball or other cardio working or agility based ""games"" and end with a final line up and hand shake to all the coaches, professor and each other. We have a bleacher type area for parents to watch the training, with free wifi and a TV lobby area with chairs and a mat for littler siblings. But be warned, after you watch your kids train for a few weeks, you may just get the bug to train yourself! Many of our kids have parents that are now training with us. It is a great way to spend some quality (and healthy) time together.";;;;;"https://www.honorrollbjj.com/schedule-jiujitsu-valencia-santaclarita-ca";;"Bruno Antunes";;"info@honorrollbjj.com";"https://www.facebook.com/HonorRollBJJ/";"https://www.youtube.com/@HonorRollBJJ";"https://youtu.be/ySx9dd2D7Kw";"https://www.instagram.com/honorroll_bjj/";"Bruno Antunes: 2003: IBJJF Worlds (Bronze) blue belt; 2007: Black Belt challenge (Gold); 2009: IBJJF South Brazilian (Silver); 2010: IBJJF South Brazilian (Silver); 2010: IBJJF South Brazilian (Bronze) Open Division; 2010: IBJJF American Nationals (Silver); 2012: IBJJF Phoenix Open (Gold); 2012: IBJJF Pan Americans (Silver); 2012: IBJJF American Nationals Gi (Gold); 2012: IBJJF American Nationals Gi (Gold) Open Division; 2012: IBJJF American Nationals NoGi (Silver); 2012: IBJJF American Nationals NoGi (Silver) Open Division; 2012: IBJJF Masters Worlds (Bronze); 2012: IBJJF Masters Worlds (Bronze) Open Division; 2015: IBJJF American Nationals (Silver)";0;237;;;"US";;

It is a style that uses superior TECHNIQUE in place of strength and power to overcome or submit an opponent. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is in essence a science in which its practitioners learn a systematic approach to utilizing leverage, balance, and position, against a larger opponents weak points. Long time practitioners of the art find that they are really learning to fight by studying the human body.The art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has exploded in popularity in the United States largely due to the achievements and accomplishments of the legendary Royce Gracie from the early days of the Ultimate fighting Championships ( U.F.C. ) in the 1990s. What Royce set out to do was to show the world the effectiveness of the art by fighting in a tournament style fashion against larger opponents from various arts including boxing, karate, taekwondo, and many more. In the end he won, and the boom of Mixed Martial Arts or M.M.A. had begun. A-Team Jiu-Jitsu is dedicated to the highest quality of martial arts training.

There’s a good reason for it: jiu jitsu is designed for weaker, smaller opponents to dominate larger ones using technique rather than strength. Being as a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten every nine seconds and has a 1 in 5 chance of being raped in her lifetime, it would make sense that jiu jitsu would be a recommended form of self defense for a group of people that is (usually) smaller and weaker than the people most likely to assault them. As someone who started jiu jitsu after nearly being sexually assaulted by a taxi driver about four years ago (and has since used it to get myself out of another sketchy situation), I’m a huge, huge proponent of anyone learning BJJ to protect themselves. That said, jiu jitsu has so much more to offer than just self defense. You’ll get in shape, develop lifelong friendships, and have a lot of fun – and that’s only the beginning!

There’s a good reason for it: jiu jitsu is designed for weaker, smaller opponents to dominate larger ones using technique rather than strength. Being as a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten every nine seconds and has a 1 in 5 chance of being raped in her lifetime, it would make sense that jiu jitsu would be a recommended form of self defense for a group of people that is (usually) smaller and weaker than the people most likely to assault them. As someone who started jiu jitsu after nearly being sexually assaulted by a taxi driver about four years ago (and has since used it to get myself out of another sketchy situation), I’m a huge, huge proponent of anyone learning BJJ to protect themselves. That said, jiu jitsu has so much more to offer than just self defense. You’ll get in shape, develop lifelong friendships, and have a lot of fun – and that’s only the beginning!

Once warmed up, the instructors will go through their daily lesson plan, step by step. Whether the kids are practicing a striking combination or a new skill, there’s always more to learn for our little ones! Although mixed martial arts itself is intense and intimidating we never lose focus that this is a kids introductory class and fun drives the instruction.

The initial program focused on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, in a time when BJJ schools were few and far between in New England, as well as the Israeli art of Krav Maga which was largely unknown at the time.  In August of 2005 MSDC opened a 7200 square foot facility in Middletown, CT and expanded its programming: now there were multiple daily classes offering Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu both with and without the gi (uniform), Bruce Lee’s Jeet Kune Do, and Mixed Martial Arts. In addition to all this, MSDC began offering a free self-defense class for members of the community that met every Thursday night (this class ran from 2005 – 2012, every Thursday). MSDC began attracting notable expert guests:  annual visits from world-renowned Jeet Kune Do, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Filipino Martial Arts, and Self-Defense expert Mr. Roy Harris, seminars from notable BJJ standout Mr. Roy Dean, workshops from movement expert Dr. Mark Cheng, rare training opportunities in the art of Kalis Ilustrisimo from Mr. Romy Macapagal, an MMA seminar with UFC veteran Mr. Jason Lambert, and a number of other workshops including Sayoc Kali, Boxe Francaise Savate, Aikido, Wing Chun, and more. From 2005-2012, MSDC flourished and provided training to hundreds of people in the greater Middletown Area.  Additional programs grew, including the Adaptive Movement Martial Arts program for kids, and the Boxe Francaise Savate French Kickboxing classes (including two trips to Montreal to train with Kickboxing legend Mr. Richard Sylla). In 2012, MSDC moved to Meriden, CT, into a beautiful facility that was well-designed to accommodate the growing number of group and private classes taught by the talented leadership team. MSDC began training more athletes, including its first Professional Mixed Martial Arts competitor. Today, private face-to-face and online training continues to be offered to clients everywhere, including online courses that can be taken anytime, and new Virtual Reality real-time instruction and courses.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighters tend to feel very comfortable fighting from a position called the guard, if need be.

Master Marcio “Macarrao” Stambowsky is the only 8th degree (red and white belt) in the northeast, and the five only under the legendary Rolls Gracie Sr. With a very deep heritage, you will get to experience firsthand authentic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu right from its source. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a grappling-based martial art that teaches its students to control resisting opponents in ways that force him/her to submit. Generally, gaining this control is easier on the ground than in a standing position. This is why much of the techniques in BJJ are centered around the skill of taking an opponent to the ground and wrestling for dominant positions, rendering the opponent harmless. The main principals behind BJJ are to control and overcome the obstacles of greater size, strength and aggression. This is done by utilizing proper technique such as superior leverage, grips, and position upon your opponent. Students gain a deep understanding of the workings and limits of the human body and also learn how to defend themselves which is very important. The knowledge can be used to subdue and control an opponent with whatever level of severity the student chooses. Once you start practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, you get to live a new lifestyle. From working out in an intelligent and fun way to being mindful about your body, what you eat, what you think, the way you breathe and many more. Jiu Jitsu is a natural problem solver, it helps you to deal with your daily life problems with tranquility. You become comfortable in any uncomfortable situation. It gives you confidence and knowledge that will make you feel safe wherever you are. BJJ is for everyone. Each person has a different goal and we are here to help you with yours. Some people just want to have a good work out, lose some weight. Some want to learn self defense, others want to compete and some people just like the fun of it, the “human chess game”.

Every instructor receives training in our unique teaching methodology, enabling them to deliver learning through dynamic interaction with the children, using a variety of approaches that meet the various learning types of individual children, whether visual, kinesthetic or auditory.";"https://valentebrothers.com/womens-program/";"The Valente Brothers Womens’ program was specifically designed to prepare women for real life threatening situations. Our Self Defense techniques provide the knowledge and skills for any woman to escape from her attacker, whether she is on her feet or on the ground. This course is unique because it does not rely exclusively on punching and kicking, as do many other forms of martial arts. Punching and kicking do not represent an effective strategy against an assailant who is bigger, stronger and capable of hitting back. In addition, they are useless on the ground, which is where a rapist/attacker is most likely to assault a woman. In addition to empowering women through the most effective self-defense techniques, the regular practice of Jiu-Jitsu represents one of the most complete forms of exercise. Students quickly notice an increase in flexibility, muscle strength, endurance and general well being.";"Fighting Foundations™, Fighting Mastery™, Military, Law Enforcement";;"https://valentebrothers.com/coral-gables/";;"James Robertson, Burak Eyilik";"Free Introductory Class";;;;;"https://www.instagram.com/gablesselfdefenseacademy/";;0;493;;;"US";;

Our Kids and Juniors Program takes a two-fold approach to developing skills for children: Martial Arts and Personal Development. Gracie Jiu Jitsu will develop an emotional balance that is a important key to inner peace, harmony, leadership, responsibility, courage and other important moral values. The Program gives your child the self control and ability to handle life’s threatening situations while building a strong foundation of self confidence. This conscience will enable your kids to develop a calmer and more tolerant disposition to be able to interact with other kids. Because Gracie Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu uses the entire body to perform techniques, children build valuable motor skills and are confident in their ability. Each class consists of physical exercises, self defense techniques and educational games. Our method will develop your child’s coordination, agility and flexibility in a fun and safe environment. We also put an emphasis on the personal development of our Youths - on the mat and off. We encourage the values of honesty, integrity, and good citizenship while focusing on self-confidence, goal setting and achievement, and using good judgment.";;;;;;;;;"info@rgacrestview.com";"https://www.facebook.com/rgacrestview";;;;;0;2031;;;"US";;

At Elite Force BJJ we believe that a well rounded Jiu-Jitsu practitioner will benefit from both forms of training. A good sport technique, for example, still utilizes leverage and timing and is effective against larger opponents. Practicing the technique against opponents of various sizes and skill levels will deepen your general understanding of these fundamental characteristics of the art, even though it does not qualify for inclusion in your street arsenal. The same way playing chess can sharpen your mind for Jiu-Jitsu, anything that improves your timing, use of leverage, and reflexes will enhance your execution of nearly all techniques. But, always remember that you must never become too reliant on any sport technique, and the key to your street survival is to develop an internal “Street Switch” that can be flipped on anytime strikes are added to the equation. ​Safety First - Our fundamentals program is safe, fun and taught in a friendly atmosphere; there are no egos on the mat. Elite Force BJJ is not a fight gym.

Jiu Jitsu approaches self-defense by emphasizing taking an opponent to the ground, gaining the dominant position, and then using any number of techniques to force them into submission either via joint manipulation or chokehold. Jiu Jitsu as translated from Japanese means ""gentle art"" as Jiu Jitsu's main focus is to control and subdue an adversary without the need to physically strike one, but rather through body positioning to maintain the upper hand. Leverage and the comprehensive understanding of body dynamics is imperative to learning Brazilian jiu jitsu. We teach... Gi - a lightweight two-piece white/blue or black garment worn in martial arts. A gi typically consists of comfortable fitting pants and a jacket that is closed with a cloth belt. This is worn for the duration of the class. No-Gi - Training without the uniform instead you wear shorts and a rash guard. You cannot grab your opponent's clothing. To be a complete BJJ player, you should train in both. Self Defense -  the use of reasonable force to protect oneself or members of the family from bodily harm from the attack of an aggressor.

Breaking boards and kicking the air is cool looking, but boards don’t hit back. The alternative to this lack of realism is to have children sparring with full force which includes strikes to the head. Since this is a bad idea for children, it leads to these martial arts to developing a mystic aura when it pertains to applicable self defense skills. Nothing is mystical about martial arts.

This knowledge can boost their confidence and provide a sense of security. Physical Fitness: BJJ is an excellent way for children to stay physically active and improve their overall fitness. It helps develop strength, flexibility, balance, and cardiovascular endurance. Discipline and Focus: Learning BJJ requires dedication and discipline. Children can benefit from the structure and focus that regular training provides, helping them develop good work habits that can extend into other areas of their lives. Problem Solving: BJJ is often referred to as ""human chess"" because it involves intricate techniques and strategies. Children can improve their critical thinking and problem-solving skills by figuring out how to counter their opponents' moves. Conflict Resolution: BJJ teaches children the importance of controlled aggression and how to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence. This valuable life skill can be applied in school, at home, and in various social situations. Physical Literacy: BJJ helps children develop their physical literacy, which includes balance, coordination, and body awareness. These skills are essential for overall motor development and can benefit children in various sports and physical activities. Teamwork and Social Skills: BJJ is often practiced in a group setting, which promotes teamwork and social interaction. Children learn to respect their training partners and build positive relationships with their peers. Mental Toughness: BJJ can be physically demanding and challenging. Children learn to push their limits, cope with discomfort, and develop mental toughness, which can be valuable in other aspects of life. Goal Setting: BJJ offers a belt system that encourages children to set and work towards goals. This can instill a sense of achievement and motivation to strive for success in other areas of their lives. Fun and Enjoyment: BJJ can be a fun and enjoyable activity for children. They often build strong bonds with their training partners and instructors, making it a positive and motivating experience.";"https://www.j3bjj.com/programs/womensselfdefense";"Brazilian (Gracie) Jiu-Jitsu emphasizes techniques that allow a smaller person to control and subdue a larger opponent. Most women have taken some sort of self defense class where you have learned striking, groin kicking and trying to run away. While striking techniques can be effective in self-defense, relying solely on them might not be the best approach. In a high-stress situation, adrenaline can cloud judgment, and precision in striking may be challenging to maintain.  The emphasis on ground fighting is especially beneficial for women, as many confrontations end up on the ground.";"Muay Thai";;"https://www.j3bjj.com/schedule";;"Jamie Williams";"Free Trial Week";"info@j3bjj.com";"https://www.facebook.com/J3BJJ";;;"https://www.instagram.com/j3_jiujitsu/";;0;523;;;"US";;

Instead of running around outside or building forts in the backyard, kids these days choose to be on their smart phones and tablets.

Here at Blind Fury Jiu-Jitsu, we teach a martial art program that is based on the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (also known as ‘BJJ’ for short). BJJ isn’t at all like the other martial arts kids and parents generally flock to, and let me tell you why…For starters, everything in BJJ is earned. Nothing is free, nothing is given away, and no one gets a participation medal. As a coach to kids for years, I can’t emphasize just how important this is for kids. In a world where fake accolades have undermined the real confidence that kids should be gaining through their involvement in sports and other activities, jiu-jitsu stands in sharp contrast to the false “everyone’s a winner” message that kids are smothering under today. In jiu-jitsu class, your child will gain real confidence based on real rewards for real work. There’s nothing that can replace the confidence a kid gains from being able to say, “I did that!” And at Blind Fury Jiu-Jitsu, your child WILL build a lifetime of memories from their accomplishments that they’ll carry with them for years to come.";;;;;"https://jiujitsucolumbus.com/schedule/";;"Jason Keaton";;;"https://www.facebook.com/jiujitsucolumbus/";"https://www.youtube.com/@jiujitsucolumbus4622/";"https://youtu.be/Rtwm--LXEMo";;"Jason Keaton - 2013 IBJJF Atlanta Open Black Belt Masters Heavyweight Champion; 2013 Tennessee State Championships Black Belt Winner; NAGA Charlotte Advanced Masters No Gi Champion; NAGA Charlotte Advanced Masters Gi Champion; Arnolds Black Belt Division Third Place; 2009 IBSA Pan American Judo Championships 2nd Place; 2009 USA Judo VI National Judo Champion; EGO Black Belt Champion; Sinister Brand Open Black Belt Runner up; Rebel Invitational Black Belt Division Champion(Judo); Highland Hills Throwdown Champion under belt(Judo); Highland Hills Throwdown Runner up Black Belt division; Legally Blind Professional MMA fighter; Inducted into the KY Fighting Hall of Fame; Instructor certificates or rank in Krav Maga, Japanese Jiujitsu, Police Defensive Tactics, Modern Army Combatives, and Wing Chun";0;2119;;;"US";;

In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 13. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one.

Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to Pink Belt!

Martial arts is, in some respects, a way of life. We do not mean that certain individuals earn a living from being in matches or teaching. Martial arts is a way of life because it practices mindfulness. When you practice a strike, a throw, or an exercise, the goal is to understand your body and be one with the movement. Eventually the goal is to, in time, be completely present in the moment and learn how to bring out that amount of centeredness when you need it. All the stresses in your life become much more manageable when you know how to find your center and understand that you have the mental tools you need to overcome the problem. Our instructors are expertly trained martial artists and experienced teachers. No matter what level a person has achieved, there is always more knowledge to gain and ways to refine one’s techniques. That is why our instructors continue to educate themselves in their martial art traditions. They understand that being able to impart knowledge is not a simple process. It requires keen observations about individuals and how they receive information, so you can make slight changes quickly to facilitate learning.

Martial arts are a great way for kids to do both these things, but the added benefit is that it’s a year-round program. Instead of seasonal sports where progress is slower, kids who participate consistently in a martial arts program will see guaranteed changes in behavior at home and school. At Kenny Kim Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, we focus on building the kids life skills while they are making friends and learning martial arts. While we can think of 10,000 reasons why kids should train BJJ, here are the top 5 reasons why our kids martial arts program is so important: 1. Physical benefits: Children who train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) are learning a healthy lifestyle by staying active, which, as most parents know, is difficult to do in the age of video games and social media! Staying active burns calories, increases good cholesterol, decreases bad cholesterol, increases flexibility, increases balance and coordination, improves fitness, maintains healthy joints and keeps the heart rate up, all while learning how to defend yourself! Proper martial arts training should be fun and educational, all while increasing a child’s self-confidence, which can in turn manifest itself in many positive ways of a child’s life. 2. Self-Esteem: Self-esteem is developed in martial arts due to the ability to grow and set goals. At first, kids in BJJ class start off setting short-term goals (getting a feel for the movements). These goals are realized after a few short months and are rewarded with a new belt or stripe. The student realizes that the effort and work put forth in the martial arts class pays off; in this case, a new belt colors. Once they realize that BJJ is for life they begin to reach for a higher goal, attaining the coveted black belt, but along the way, self-esteem and self-confidence is growing, along with the child. 3. Bully proof: Bullying is a well-documented and growing problem in schools these days. And with no signs of slowing down, martial arts training can give much needed tools to the child on how to better deal with bullies and bullying situations. Martial arts teach children to stand up for themselves and for others if there is a bullying situation. Preventing bullying does not mean resorting to violence, it means having the confidence to stand up for what is right. However, what’s worse for parents than learning their child is being a bully, is that their child is a bully him/herself. At Kenny Kim Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, we focus on developing strong human beings; learning to help others, not hurt them. 4. Mental Health: Apart from self-esteem, BJJ is very mentally challenging which helps kids develop character. Compared to other martial arts, it can take up to 10 yrs. for adults to reach black belt because of the complexity of the art. The ability of a BJJ student to learn how to deal with obstacles in a controlled environment gives the benefit of increased mental health because the student develops the ever-important “Never Give Up” attitude. That attitude is imperative in developing leaders and strong individuals who don’t see a limit to what they can accomplish and learn how to navigate their way through challenges. Along the way, your child will gain self-discipline, self-confidence, focus, and respect, just to name a few of the many mental benefits of training. 5. Awareness: The last thing any parent wants is a lost child. Typically, the child is fine and found in a few minutes. But what if the worst-case scenario presented itself?  Realistically, can a child defend themselves against an adult? Probably not. But a child can learn how to be aware of their surroundings, and take the necessary steps to prevent dangerous situations. BJJ teaches children to be flexible, make quick decisions, and take action while remaining calm.";;;;;"https://kennykimbjj.com/schedule";;"Kenny Kim";"Free class is for New students only that live in the metro Atlanta area interested in getting to learn about the program.";"service@kennykimbjj.com";"https://www.facebook.com/kennykimbjj";"https://www.youtube.com/@kennykimbjj/";"https://youtu.be/1s3k1-dBEc4";"https://www.instagram.com/kennykimacademy/";;0;540;;;"US";;

Preparation leads to confidence and confidence leads to success! We train our children to carry themselves with honor and confidence. We teach them the necessary tools to resolve a confrontation with verbal assertiveness, but if the confrontation becomes physical, they are able to control the situation and defend themselves without hurting their attacker. This is one of the main differences between Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and other Martial Arts such as Karate and Tae Kwon Do, the ability to control someone without the use of a single strike. Our curriculum guides them through warm-ups that develop their strength, flexibility and coordination. They learn effective stand up and ground techniques to defend from the most common bully attacks. Through sparring and drills they develop their reflexes and muscle memory. Children become more FOCUSED, DISCIPLINED, RESPECTFUL and GRATEFUL among other things. This improvement follows them into other facets of life such as school and home.

The statistics show that this will be an uphill battle though; 28% of children report being bullied throughout their middle school and high school experiences. Research shows over half of all bullying can be stopped by the victim verbally asserting themselves, and standing their ground against their aggressor. However, this is much easier said than done. A bully chooses it’s target wisely and will hone in on the children he or she perceives as having low self-esteem. A child’s mind is wired for its personal safety first, and many times the psychological fear of physical violence is enough to keep them from standing up for themselves, and that’s where we come in. Kids Self Defense Classes - Learning an *effective* self-defense system like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu will empower your child with the confidence needed to stand up for themselves. This does not mean that they will march into the school and try to start a fight with every kid that looks at them funny! A confident child carries himself in a way that will deter bullies. With the knowledge that the bully cannot physically harm them, they will hold no psychological edge over your child, and they cease to be a victim. Our kid’s classes use games and concepts found in the award-winning Gracie Bully Proof program, which is a great supplement in academy training. All of our techniques are taught in a manner that emphasizes self-defense and possible schoolyard situations. Kids Martial Arts - If you are looking for an effective martial art for your child, then Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is the art for you and them. BJJ was developed so that the smaller, less athletic, individual can survive, progress, and then capitalize on their opponents’ weaknesses. Understanding how to grapple with another individual and using technique and leverage is an invaluable tool for any child. We specialize in teaching young individuals how to use their body most effectively with BJJ. We are a short drive from Fayetteville, Peachtree City, Newnan, Senoia, and Sharpsburg. Come see why we are the number one Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school for kids and adults in the South Metro area.";;;"Boxing, Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Boot Camp";;"https://ptccombatfitness.com/schedule/";;"Pete Snider";;"ptccombatfitness@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/PTCCombatFitness";"https://www.youtube.com/@ptccombatfitness6726/";"https://youtu.be/m2He3IOmGMY";"https://www.instagram.com/ptccombatfitness/";;0;2135;;;"US";;

Any child who loves going to the class, tries their best, and attends consistently will get good at the martial arts. There are so many things in a child’s life to be serious about, like their school work, chores, etc.. Every child needs an activity that is fun. It is even better when that activity is one that gives the child exercise, increases flexibility and builds strength, teaches them how to defend themselves and the respect and discipline to know when to use it and, more importantly, when not to. We do not want over demanding parents to bring their children to our academy and demand that we make them into the next champion of the world. If your child will become a world champion, he or she will make that decision themselves because the desire needs to come from within themselves. To reach that level, they cannot be forced to obtain those types of skills.  Every child that we have built into a champion developed a passion for the martial arts on their own. We enjoy watching the children’s self confidence and self esteem grow as their technical proficiency grows. Not every child will become a champion, but every child deserves to feel a boost in their self esteem & self confidence, and feel better about themselves through the learning of the martial arts. We are not only building champions in martial arts, we are building champions in life. We reserve the right to not accept certain students both adults and children. Acceptance of children for the kids class will be based on the child’s level of maturity. If the child can sit still for a little while listening to instruction, pay attention, and TRY to attempt some moves when shown something, they will be accepted. We are not asking for young adults, but this is also not a baby sitting class. We also do not feel right about taking money from parents if the children is not ready to learn.  Every child is different and progress at different rates. That is the great thing about kids. Our classes target 6 – 14 year olds. We are always open to ideas, suggestions and willing to try just about anything, so do not be afraid to ask or offer.  Kids 15 years and older are encouraged to attend our adult classes. Our goals in the Kids class are to have fun, build self-confidence and self-worth, emphasize academics, build discipline, develop humility and respect for others, instill good ethics and morals, be an “extended family” support team for the child, and increase flexibility and overall fitness through the learning of Jiu-Jitsu.";;;;"Registration fee - $100.

Whether you have never tried a martial arts sport or have been doing jiu-jitsu for years, all levels and types of students are welcome at TPJJ. TPJJ opened under Master Relson Gracie 5th Degree Black Belt Kaleo Auwae in January of 2005. Born and raised in Papakolea, Kaleo has been training under Master Relson Gracie since September 1994 in Hawaii during the early days and birth of the UFC.  Since then he has produced multiple champions with his teachings in all ranks and weight classes in both kids and adults divisions. He is also a champion himself being a NAGA (North American Grappling Association). From humble beginnings in 2005 as the Papakolea Fight Club, TPJJ was established to provide a positive influence and help both children and adults in the Papakolea area to improve not only their heath and fitness, but also to provide a positive alternative to stay on the right path.

Whether you have never tried a martial arts sport or have been doing jiu-jitsu for years, all levels and types of students are welcome at TPJJ. TPJJ opened under Master Relson Gracie 5th Degree Black Belt Kaleo Auwae in January of 2005. Born and raised in Papakolea, Kaleo has been training under Master Relson Gracie since September 1994 in Hawaii during the early days and birth of the UFC.  Since then he has produced multiple champions with his teachings in all ranks and weight classes in both kids and adults divisions. He is also a champion himself being a NAGA (North American Grappling Association). From humble beginnings in 2005 as the Papakolea Fight Club, TPJJ was established to provide a positive influence and help both children and adults in the Papakolea area to improve not only their heath and fitness, but also to provide a positive alternative to stay on the right path.

Ever since Gracie Jiu-Jitsu was created in Brazil, perfected by the Grand Master, Helio Gracie, and brought to our island of Maui by our patriarch, Luis "" 'Limão "" Heredia, students have enhanced their quality of life, overcome personal struggle, and found new meaning and camaraderie through its pursuit. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was created to allow a weaker, less athletic person, to be able to defend themselves against a much larger, stronger opponent. However, it became much more than that. Many students have found BJJ as a way to build confidence, overcome adversity, and find a place where they feel welcome and accepted, like Ohana. Professor Gilberto Castro, a black belt under ""Luis"" 'Limão "" Heredia, shared this vision and set a goal to bring all the benefits he learned throughout his journey to black belt, to the local community of West Maui. He wanted to create a place where anyone willing to put in the time and effort, could grow as a person, and discover something inside themselves they never imagined possible. Professor Gilberto also has a special passion to see women empowered through the art of Jiu-Jitsu and strives to create an inclusive atmosphere for all to feel welcome. Lastly, He has a deep desire to build a better community through the mentorship and development of Keiki programs and competition teams.

We believe in a balance of structure, discipline, fun, and play. Jiu Jitsu should be a reflection of your lifestyle. Every class starts with body mechanics and tumbling awareness, followed by instruction, rolling (sparring), and a game. Currently our kids program is an All Ages setting. The age range for the kids program is 7 – 14 years old. This gives young kids the opportunity to look up to our slightly older teens as mentors to aspire to as the teens transition into the Adult Classes. Kids classes can get very busy so we have at least 2-3 adult coaches on the mats for supervision. Our Curriculum. We encourage our kids with our teaching style to instill a sense of constant growth of their Jiu Jitsu, while still keeping it playful. Belt progression is determined by a balanced mixture of attendance, attention and participation of the student in the instruction setting and as a partner for others, character off the mat, and skill improvement. Sign Up. There is an iPad at the front desk where the parent or guardian will register their child for a kids membership and sign their liability waiver. Once this is complete the kids are welcome to join us on the mats! Equipment. Kids receive a free Jiu Jitsu gi with their first month of membership. We also offer kids team apparel, patches, stickers, and accessories. We encourage the kids to wear a mouth guard and have a rash guard and board shorts for the no gi class on Thursdays. On The Mats.

They are taught how to handle verbal, relational, and physical bullying. They learn what bullying really is and what to do about it. They are also taught to help others who may be victims. Most importantly, they learn to walk and talk with confidence, and how to speak and act with strength. As students gain experience, their training becomes more and more challenging. Their instruction includes more advanced techniques and more intensive training. They earn belts and gain skills that prepare them to move into the adult program later on. As they move along, students learn to develop good nutrition and physical health. They learn to set and accomplish goals and overcome challenges. Most importantly, they learn that treating others with kindness and expecting kindness from others is a sign of strength. Huge emphasis is placed on character and good decision making. Students are taught to give respect and to expect it in return. We talk a lot about bullying in schools, but it is a society-wide problem. It is often present in the workplace, in colleges and universities, on social media, at sporting events, and even at church. Anywhere that individuals are allowed to use power or strength to harm others, victimization can occur. Soma Jiu-Jitsu Academy teaches individuals of all ages how to prevent and respond to the imbalance of power that makes bullying and victimization possible - from road rage to harassment at school. Both Adult and Child/Youth Soma Jiu-Jitsu programs are specifically designed to empower individuals and help them avoid becoming victims of any kind. Team members are taught to: Avoid becoming a target by using respect and civility, while projecting strength and competence; Put a stop to name-calling and verbal harassment by addressing disrespect immediately; Stop physical confrontations without needing to throw a single punch; When necessary, subdue an aggressor in a legal and ethical way to keep themselves and their families safe. ​Courses are taught by Jared Emfield, a former school teacher, principal, and superintendent who understands precisely what is going on in today's schools, and that laws and policies often empower the bully as much as they do the victim. The Soma Jiu-Jitsu program stops families from relying solely on schools, employers, etc. to provide protection, and empowers individuals and their families to put a stop to bullying and aggression.";;;;;"http://www.idahofallsbjj.com/class-schedule.html";;"Jared Emfield";;;"https://www.facebook.com/SomaJiuJitsuAcademyIdahoFalls/";"https://www.youtube.com/@TheSomaAcademy/";"https://youtu.be/MChrp98M0Eg";;;0;2241;;;"US";;

It’s never too early to introduce your young child to the benefits of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu! Our Baby Rhinos program will get them use to being on the mats and build their foundation in their future Gracie Jiu-Jitsu training. Through fun and safe games, your child will learn how to move their bodies while being introduced to the fundamentals. Gracie Jiu-Jitsu will help improve their balance, coordination, and body awareness while also building their confidence, discipline, and social skills. We are offering a free trial classes on May 17th 5:45pm and May 22nd 10:30am, for your child to participate in before the next 6-week session that begins May 22nd. Classes are held on Mondays at 10:30am and at 5:45pm. One parent is required to be on the mat with their child (or someone 18 and older) we have found that students will focus better in this program with a parent and it also allows you to spend mat time with your child! When they turn 4 they are able to move up to our Lil Rhinos program. Lil Rhinos - Welcome to our Lil Rhinos program, specifically tailored for young explorers aged 4-6! As a parent, you're always looking for opportunities that enrich your child's life, and that's exactly what we offer. Our Gracie Jiu-Jitsu classes go beyond the basics of martial arts, providing a nurturing space where your little one can learn invaluable self-defense techniques. But it's so much more than just self-defense; it's a foundation for life. Imagine your child, brimming with confidence, not just on the mat but in every aspect of their life. Our program emphasizes physical development, focusing on strength, flexibility, coordination, and balance. This not only aids in their motor skill enhancement but also in developing a keen sense of body awareness. We invite you and your little one to join Team Rhino with a two-week trial. The first class will be one-on-one with an instructor explaining what Jiu-Jitsu is, work on basic techniques and then they will take three more classes with the Lil Rhinos students. Youth Crash - Team Rhino's Gracie Jiu-Jitsu program offers a range of benefits that make it a preferred choice for parents when it comes to enrolling their children. One primary reason is addressing instances of bullying that can significantly impact a child's self-esteem. Unlike traditional organized sports, where not all children may feel comfortable participating, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu provides a unique avenue for physical activity without the pressure of sitting on the sidelines, waiting for their turn. Through Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, children can engage in physical exercise in a supportive environment that emphasizes skill development and personal growth rather than competition. This approach helps children build confidence and self-esteem as they progress in their training. As students gain proficiency in Gracie Jiu-Jitsu techniques under the guidance of our experienced instructors, they become eligible to join our Advanced Crash classes, further enhancing their skills and confidence.";;;;;"https://teamrhinoidaho.com/schedule/";;;;"staff@teamrhinoidaho.com";"https://www.facebook.com/teamrhinogracie";"https://www.youtube.com/@teamrhinograciejiu-jitsu9569";"https://youtu.be/XodwYFTa0ks";"https://www.instagram.com/teamrhinojiujitsu/";;0;561;;;"US";;

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a fantastic way to promote an active and healthy lifestyle for kids of any ages. Parents of our students often find that their children gain self-esteem through athletic achievement and learn how to carry themselves better in situations that require them to deal with pressure. If your son or daughter is acting overly aggressive in school, lacks focus and or discipline then we at Gracie Springfield recommend you start them out with a private lesson to introduce them to the sport and class structure. They will learn that Commitment, Respect, Focus, Self-Discipline and effort always make a rewarding experience and bring positive results.";;;;;"http://www.graciehumaitaspringfieldil.com/#schedule";;"Mark Commean";;"contact@ghspringfield.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GHSpringfieldIL/";;;"https://www.instagram.com/ghspringfieldil/";;0;2255;;;"US";;

We teach children how they can use Jiu-Jitsu against larger and stronger opponents without using kicks, punches, or strength. Kids will learn escapes from a variety of positions as well as the ability to control their opponent without hurting them. Each day in class we let the children test out the techniques against resisting classmates to ensure their confidence in each technique. b.Sport – Jiu-Jitsu also has a Sport component where the child can use the same techniques in local and national tournaments. Competing with your teammates builds teamwork and a sense of belonging. It is not required for advancement, but if your child has the desire to compete, he/she can compete with the most respected name in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu: Carlson Gracie. c.Physical fitness – It is estimated that from the early 1970’s until present, the number of obese children has tripled in the United States. Our program has a strong physical fitness component that not only helps the child learn Jiu-Jitsu, but gets them in shape! Our “warm-up” consists of falling practice, pushups, situps and other Jiu-Jitsu related techniques that build a strong body and mind. This method of teaching improves the child’s self-esteem, physical fitness and self-confidence. All of the techniques used in the children’s program translate directly into the adult proram, making their transition seamless.

"Imazaki Dojo";"https://www.imazakidojo.com/";(312) 753-3359;"1620 S. Michigan Ave";"Chicago";"IL";60616;;"United States";"Sensei Seijo Imazaki started training in Folk style wrestling when he was 10 years old. He wrestled for 7 years in high school and also wrestled Freestyle and Greco Roman in tournaments during the off season. He finished his high school wrestling career with a 124W-14L varsity record. During which he won numerous tournaments all over New York state. In 2001 he started studying Tae Kwon Do. He received his yellow belt and competed in 2 tournaments, one of which was the regionals and he took 1st in his division. Realizing Tae Kwon Do wasn’t for him, Seijo stumbled upon the World Oyama Karate Head Quarters on West 4th st, NYC in 2003. Training there for one month Soshu Shigeru Oyama invited Seijo to be an Uchi Deshi. Although, at that time, Seijo was not ready to take that step, he did in fact fall in love with karate and began his journey. Unfortunately, the Dojo closed down. A few of the Oyama Sensei’s started teaching private classes and over the next three years he took classes, sporadically. Seijo never lost his passion for Karate but hadn’t found the right home yet. Then in 2006, he found World Oyama Karate Dojo in NYC run by Sensei Matsumoto. Soon after joining, he was invited to be an Uchi Deshi. He moved into the Dojo and became a full time student of karate, which means he did Karate at least 6 hours a day and then also cared for the Dojo, with the hopes of opening his own dojo one day. He was an Uchi Deshi for 6 months and received his orange belt within that time. After his time as Uchi Deshi, Seijo was ready for a change. He began training with Sensei Iwata, a former World Oyama teacher. With Sensei Iwata, Seijo trained in the Dojo intensely, rarely missing a class. As a green belt, Seijo would enter full knockdown tournaments and fight his heart out. In June of 2010, Seijo earned his 1st Dan rank from Sensei Iwata. Seijo fought very hard for his black belt, enduring 15, 2 minute rounds consecutively. The test caught on tape has become an inspiration to many. In 2011 Seijo and Sensei Iwata parted ways. Later that year, Seijo went on to win the North American Kyokushin-kai Championship at middle weight. Then Sensei Seijo joined an organization called Kenwakan Karate founded by Shihan Michelle Gay formerly of World Oyama Karate and Kanreikai. At Kenwakan, Seijo was constantly working on everything from technique and kata to fighting strategies and combinations. He trained the fight team and still competes in Full Knockdown Karate. Seijo was given the title of Sensei.He also received his 2nd Dan. Kenwakan gave Sensei Seijo the opportunity to work with children, which is something he always wanted to do. He saw the value in teaching children the art of karate and all it had to offer, physically and mentally. Sensei Seijo helped run the kids and adult programs at Kenwakan. In 2015, Sensei Seijo and Imazaki Dojo were asked to join a world renowned organization called So-Kyokushin. They accepted and consider it an honor to be part of such an extraordinary group of Karata-ka led by Shihan Kazuyuki Hasegawa and Saiko Shihan Diago Ohishi. Currently Sensei Seijo Imazaki teaches Karate full time and is also studying Brazilian Jujitsu. He also has started competing in MMA (Mixed Martial Art). He had his first fight on December 6th 2014. Winner By Knockout Ushiro Mawashi Geri “Back Spin kick” 2nd Round. His 2nd MMA Fight was on Feb. 5th 2015. Winner By Rear Naked Choke 1st Round. Sensei Seijo Imazaki 3rd MMA Fight on June 26th 2015 . Winner Unanimous Decision. April 1st, 2016 Imazaki became the UCL Champion by unanimous decision.

At Movimento we are passionate about our personal approach to kids’ jiu jitsu classes. While many kids’ martial arts involve repetitive, static poses, we believe that the best training is done through patient instruction and carefully observed, dynamic partner work. Unlike striking arts, such as karate and taekwondo, jiu jitsu uses leverage and body position to throw, sweep, pin, and submit opponents - regardless of their size or strength. This means that while little ones won’t be breaking any boards, the self-defense skills they do learn will be immediately applicable. As they progress, through perseverance and plenty of encouragement, kids will develop a strong sense of self-confidence, discipline, and a healthy respect for others. Classes are designed for kids as young as 6 and require a traditional uniform, called a gi. This encourages the use of highly refined techniques, thoughtful strategies, and careful control. Each class begins with a warm-up, including cardio exercises and fun games. From there we move on to a daily technique, and finish with live sparring.

In the Gracie Bullyproof program, our goal is to instill your child with unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 8 and 13. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof program is for you! Even if your child has previously tried Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and had a negative experience, we can assure you that they will absolutely love the Gracie Bullyproof program!";"https://fusionacademyofmartialarts.com/women-empowered/";"Women Empowered® is the official Gracie Jiu-Jitsu® self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ).

Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to pink belt! Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the perfect self-defense system for women, but only if it is taught correctly.

Our program teaches each child proven effective techniques that will help them stand up for themselves when necessary. Our 22 class Kid’s curriculum provides your child the opportunity to have courage, self-control, respect, and discipline, while at the same time having fun. Your child’s concentration, coordination, and fitness levels will also improve. Classes are structured with exercises, technique instruction, and drills. Classes are for children ages 8 – 13.

Our techniques will provide you with the skills and knowledge to escape from an attacker, whether you are standing on your feet or on the ground.  The escape moves are based on leverage and technique and do not require strength, speed or coordination.  Our self-defense techniques are unique as they do not rely exclusively on striking, as other martial arts.  Striking based techniques are not effective against a bigger, stronger person, and are useless on the ground, which is where you may end up when being attacked.

At Kroyler Gracie Jiu-Jitsu we have continued this tradition and we’re proud to offer a program that is catered to young students. From the very beginning, your child will learn age-appropriate verbal and physical techniques to help them avoid, survive, and win a physical altercation against a bigger, stronger opponent. However, the benefits of Jiu-Jitsu go far beyond learning a martial art for self-defense. Learning Jiu-jitsu is about overcoming challenges. The training can sometimes be difficult. This is a great lesson for children as each time they solve a problem or overcome adversity their self-confidence will grow. Self-confidence is one of the most important benefits for children as it makes them less-likely to become a victim of bullying or abuse. Training will develop a healthy body. Children have become more sedentary and dependent on devices. Regular Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practice will help them improve the health of their body as our curriculum focuses on improving their: Balance, Coordination, Stamina/Endurance, Body control, Strength and Flexibility as well as greater mental strength and focus. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a full body workout that improves functional fitness. Our classes cater to all fitness levels and we focus on giving each child the tools that they need to improve their lives.The mental aspect of Jiu-Jitsu. Training will keep their mind active and engaged as Jiu-Jitsu is about making strategic decisions and improving critical thinking skills. The benefits extend beyond the academy as your child participates in other activities. We believe that the mental benefits of training are equally as important as the physical aspects. Giving your child the confidence to think through a situation and solve a problem with their mind is a very powerful tool. The social benefits of training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu are priceless. We create a healthy environment where like-minded people come together to share the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Your child will be encouraged to interact with other children through the physical practice of training, but the real benefit happens when the children start working together to help each other achieve their goals. This is a natural occurring process at our academy because we foster an atmosphere of teamwork and respect. Friendships made on the mat (at the academy) often last a lifetime and we believe that surrounding yourself with healthy, positive people, will benefit your child as they move through different phases of their life. At Kroyler Gracie Jiu-Jitsu we believe that children of all ages can learn and benefit from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, as such we have created a new class that was designed specifically for young children (4-6 years old). The Fundamentals of Jiu-Jitsu Program is focused specifically on the needs of the younger kids and helps the family grow together! At Kroyler Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, we are dedicated to helping your child achieve their goals.

The Mat Munchkins class is scheduled every Monday (5:45-6:15PM). Each child must be accompanied by a parent in each Mat Munchkins class. Since the children will only be doing the techniques/games with grownups, the parent does not need to enroll in a separate membership, but does need to have their own uniform/gi.

Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents.

On a professional level, Jack is a 5th degree Black Belt in the art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under legendary instructor Wellington “Megaton” Dias.

In addition to BJJ, Jack is also certified in Bruce Lee’s art of Jeet Kune Do and Filipino Martial Arts (Kali) under legendary instructors Dan Inosanto and Paul Vunak. Jack still considers himself a student of martial arts. That helps to keep his passion alive for his students. Although Jack hones his skills by competing in tournaments, his strength and true passion is teaching others. While many martial arts instructors hold various jobs during the week and teach only in the evening or weekends, Jack makes his living teaching others.

We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus!

Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents.

Our goal is to help our students awaken their potential. The idea of Three Rivers Martial Arts Academy was developed in March 1995 on the back of a Chong’s restaurant placemat. Seven martial artists, all from different backgrounds, wrote down what we wanted the academy to be. We hoped to relate to others the change we saw in ourselves through martial arts. We wanted it to be an idea, not a promotion. We vowed to teach in a way that would demonstrate to the community that the study of martial arts was on par with any other field of endeavor such as medicine, engineering, etc. That year, we opened in a small space at the Executive Inn, and grew to fill a larger area in the same hotel within a couple of years. We were excited about what we were doing and knew it was special because we saw growth in the academy despite being located in a basement behind a floodwall. In April 1999, we moved to 900 Broadway in historic downtown Paducah. To accommodate our growing academy, we moved again in 2008 to Energy Fitness. Our last move was in 2020 to our new location on the opposite side of The Gym, which is a state-of-the-art fitness facility, formerly Energy Fitness. With the help of friends, family, community leaders, and dedicated students that have grown into experienced instructors, the academy has continued to unfold into the most accredited and professional school in the area.";;;;;;"Jun Fan Kickboxing, Tai Ji Quan, Filipino Kali, Indonesian Silat";;"https://threeriversacademy.com/dev/scheduling/";;"Jason Hawkins";;"3riversacademy@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/3riversacademy";"https://www.youtube.com/@3RAcademy";"https://youtu.be/zhYYJBnw6SE";"https://www.instagram.com/three.rivers.academy/";;0;2382;;;"US";;

We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one.";"https://graciededham.com/programs/women-empowered/";"Women Empowered® is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 15-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 20 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to pink belt! Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the perfect self-defense system for women, but only if it is taught correctly. If you’re unsure about learning BJJ for fear of injury, embarrassment, or any other reason, then the Women Empowered program is perfect for you! If you’ve tried BJJ at another school and had a negative experience, give Women Empowered a chance, and we guarantee it will win you back to the mat!";;"Gracie Combatives - $162/month unlimited, Gracie Bullyproof - $162/month unlimited,  The Master Cycle - $162/month unlimited";"https://graciededham.com/schedule/";;"David Chan";"Free Trial Class";"GracieDedham@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GracieJiuJitsuDedham/";;"https://youtu.be/I83OxWpWTiQ";"https://www.instagram.com/graciejiujitsudedham/";;0;2455;;;"US";;

In our ages 3-6 and 7-9 class, we end class with a ""game"". The games we play in class are designed to trick the younger kids into learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. In their mind they are just having fun and playing a game, while in reality they are learning important body movements and skills that will help them improve in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. In our ages 10-16 class, we end the class with sparring, often times called ""rolling"".

We are primarily a stand-up Jiu Jitsu style with an emphasis on standing defense, defense against weapons, ground defense, and multiple attackers.";"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/552c6c38e4b0c230032e2f96/1429820776474-HEFK4PKTCT0STRF2I6XH/majj_logo.png?format=500w";"https://www.metrowestacademy.com/kids-jiu-jitsu";"Little Ninjas | Ages 4–6 Yrs - Our unique program combines the structure of traditional martial arts with fun games and activities to develop a wide range of valuable skills in your child.

Whether you are interested in self defense, relieving stress, losing weight, or just looking for a new way to exercise, we have a program that will suit your needs. We offer programs in Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) (both gi and no gi), Boxing, MMA and Kickboxing. Adults or teens students who train in any of our programs are also welcome to join our Mixed Martial Arts class. K I Salem MA. sets itself apart from other programs through the quality of our instruction and focus on the overall development of our students. The lessons our students learn in class extend beyond self defense to all aspects of life. Along with developing better fitness, our students develop a healthy sense of self confidence and discipline that help them achieve any goal they set for themselves. Though many lessons are common to all martial arts, we feel it is important that the nature of each martial art style remain unique. Unlike other programs that try to “blend” different styles into a new system, our classes keep different martial arts separated into their native styles. This is done for several reasons: 1) Out of respect for the history of each style, we seek to preserve the rich traditions that each style has to offer. 2) Each of our instructors has extensive experience in his or her style. Students receive higher quality training through focused attention from an experienced teacher. 3) Different students have different interests. Our offerings allow each student to train in what he or she is interested in. Of course, many people today are interested in martial arts because of the popularity of Mixed Martial Arts. If you look at top MMA fighters, they generally hold a black belt in one martial art and receive additional training in other styles to complement their main interest. We believe this is the best way for anyone interested in MMA to train. As a result, anyone interested in MMA is expected to train in one of our other programs. Our students come from a variety of ages, backgrounds, interests, and levels of ability.

We also add in fun games, fitness and agility training! This class also involves our Character Development & Bully Defense Program. We believe in building up our younger students to be good citizens of the world, learning to develop strong self confidence, respect for others, and the importance of trying your best in life! At NSBJJ we believe that our Jiu-Jitsu Kids should be learning in a fun environment, with no pressure. This age is an important development stage in a child’s life, and if pushed and pressured too early they will not want to continue with their training or sport, as it will no longer be fun for them. We want to help kids learn respect and focus, but also have fun and be kids! Jr. Jiu-Jitsu Program - Ages 9-14 - These classes include lots of physical exercise, Jiu-Jitsu specific warm ups and agility training. At NSBJJ we feel that as kids get older it is more important for them to be fit, active and have proper body awareness to better adapt to their growing bodies and to establish an active lifestyle that will stay with them into adulthood. In the Jr. Jiu-Jitsu Program we work with the kids on self-discipline, focus, fitness and fun!  At NSBJJ we practice and teach Self-Defense first, but it is just as important to teach ""Verbal Jiu-Jitsu"" (Verbal Assertiveness) to help stop Bullying and Peer Pressure by stopping the threat before it gets physical. These techniques also help tremendously with Self-Confidence.";;;;;"https://www.northshorebjj.com/schedule";;"Danny Morera";;"angela@northshorebjj.com";"https://www.facebook.com/northshorebjj";"https://www.youtube.com/@northshorebrazilianjiujitsu/";"https://youtu.be/JUl86UT_X08";"https://www.instagram.com/northshorebjj/";;0;2446;;;"US";3142;

Owner Nick Tissue began training in martial arts as a young child. After graduating college, he began teaching karate at his older brother's school in 2008. Soon after, he began training judo and Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and opened a school in Towson, MD in 2010. After meeting and training with Rener and Ryron Gracie in 2013, he decided he wanted to open a new school in Baltimore specializing in Gracie Combatives® and the Gracie University System. As a Federal Hill resident for over 6 years, Nick realized there were no martial arts schools in the city, and he wanted to bring his love for jiu-jitsu to his community. A year later Baltimore Gracie Jiu-Jitsu came to be. In the summer of 2019 Baltimore Gracie Jiu-Jitsu moved to a larger facility in southwest Baltimore. Nick wanted to shy away from the traditional competition-style schools and with the mindset that anyone can do jiu-jitsu, Baltimore Gracie Jiu-Jitsu has become a very family-friendly school, with classes for kids, adults, women, beginners, and veterans.

BJJ is also a popular sport and is especially well suited for kids that prefer to not engage in team activities. In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, we avoid being punched or kicked by taking our opponents to the ground via a throw or wrestler’s takedown. Once on the ground, an opponent or bully who unfamiliar with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is helpless because they are restricted in their ability to move. We teach our children not to be bullies or misuse the skills that they learn but to be helpful and compassionate to others. BJJ training fosters confidence and self control and helps to develop a child's character. Our Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program is very popular. We have in excess of 150 junior BJJ students. Our children’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program is headed by the owner of the school, Sensei Gary Berger. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a more modern art in comparison to other more traditional styles like Karate, Tae Kwon Do and Judo. Kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Classes in Catonsville Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has become a very sought after martial art style all over the world ever since it was featured on television in the mid 90’s. Master Berger has been teaching Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to children since 1995, longer than any other known BJJ institution in Maryland. Baltimore Martial Arts children’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program has a competition team that travels and competes in numerous tournaments along the east coast. For years, out Junior BJJ competition team has won numerous individual and team championships. Competition isn’t for every child. We don’t force anyone to compete if they don’t want to.

In this class, the goal is to have FUN and begin building the student’s confidence in themselves. Positional control and self-defense is taught though a series of jiu jitsu based “Gracie Games” which will teach the child how to be comfortable in a physical situation, and avoid being hurt by another child who is behaving aggressively. From the first time the students start learning jiu jitsu, they also begin to learn when and how it is to be used. That’s where the Character Development Program comes in! A portion of every class is dedicated to discussion about possible scenarios that children may encounter in their daily lives, and how they can incorporate character-building principles.

Carlos Catania, Charles Cherry, Rob Tipton, and Matthew Brannon all met while training at another Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) school in the area. ​​Carlos Catania was the head BJJ instructor who received his black belt in BJJ from Sergio Penha. Charles Cherry incorporated his backgrounds in wrestling and Judo to the BJJ mix. Eventually, Matthew Brannon would become the first MMA fighter from Bowie MMA to turn Pro. Bowie MMA became a respected competition MMA and BJJ team under the tutelage of Carlos and Charles. While instructing at Bowie MMA, Charles obtained his black belt in BJJ from Carlos Catania with the approval of Sergio Penha. In 2018, Carlos and Charles ventured into different business avenues but the two friends will forever remain brothers. Bowie MMA officially changed its name to Bellicose Martial Arts in 2020 to reflect a move to its current location in Crofton, Maryland. Bellicose, defined as ""demonstrating aggression and willingness to fight,"" was an effort to shed the image of mixed martial artist fighting in a cage and to focus on a more family friendly and holistic martial arts environment. As part of the move, Bellicose joined the Evolution Fight Team headed by 5th degree BJJ black belt, Carlos David Oliveira. Bellicose Martial Arts teaches a mix of martial arts which include Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Judo, Thai Kickboxing, Tae Kwon Do, and Krav Maga. Today, Bellicose Martial Arts is run by Charles Cherry and Quenton ""Coach Q"" King. Coach Q is a certified Krav Maga instructor under Jaime Lee who is also certified by the Wingate Institute in Israel for Krav Maga.

It focuses on the skill of taking an opponent to the ground, controlling the opponent,  gaining a dominant position and using a number of techniques for submission by either joint locks or chokeholds. BJJ revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them.

In an era of increased bullying, your child will learn how to avoid and effectively defend themselves in dangerous situations. 2. Your child will gain confidence in life which will help them to excel and succeed in everything they take on. 3. Your child will learn respect and common courtesy. These are the first 2 ingredients in child safety and behavior. 4. Martial Arts keeps your child active and helps them to develop a healthy and fit lifestyle. 5. Martial Arts is for everyone! It is not a team consisting of all the best athletes. No one sits on the bench. 6. Your child will learn Self-Control. Self-Control helps children to be patient and gentle in intense situations rather than angry and aggressive. This is an important aspect for handling any emergency situation! While it is also important that a child knows how to be aggressive in certain situations, it should be a choice and not an out of control reaction! 7. Your child will develop lasting relationships with good people. We provide a positive community for your children to become part of. There are so many ways Martial Arts can benefit your child and even your whole family. The list goes on and on. The best way to find out is to bring them in and see for yourself!

During Master Shigueru his first class at the Sao Paulo academy, he began sparring without any knowledge and the result was a dislocated shoulder but this did not deter his program is the art. After the World War II, the Yamasaki family moved to the city and started to train with Master Ryuzo Ogawa. The Yamasaki brothers were quick learners in mastering the sport and the Yamasaki family opened their first school on the early 1950′s following the guidance of Master Ryuzo Ogawa. At this time, the Yamasaki Academy continued using the Judo terminology to describe the art. The Yamasaki Academy was an instant success and within a short time, the Yamasaki family had 12 locations. By the earl 1960′s, the terminology had changed from that of Judo to become what is known as modern Jiu- Jitsu which became the focus of the adult training programs. The interest in Jiu-Jitsu was quickly growing beyond just adults and the Yamasaki brothers pioneered a new youth martial arts program in Sao Paulo which was based on a completely new methodology. Over the past 70 years, the rules of judo have undergone a great change and Master Shigueto Yamasaki was asked by his student Carlos Catalano to collaborate with the innovations based on his deep experience in the sport. Master Shigueto Yamasaki acted as referee in the Olympics of Montreal (1976), Moscow (1980), Los Angeles (1984), and Seoul (1988). Master Shigueru Yamasaki was also a referee for the Olympics in Barcelona (1992). The Yamasaki brothers were also the coaches for the Brazilian National team for many opportunities. After having started families, both brothers kept focus on coaching, raising their families, and training future champions. The oldest brother Shigueto had 3 kids, including his middle son, Shigueto Yamasaki Jr. who as a teenager was Brazilian national champion and eventually became the Judo Pan-American champion, European tour champion, and in ’92 became an Olympian at the Barcelona Olympic games. Shigueru raised Mario, Fernando, and daughters Solange and Eliana. Both Fernando and Mario trained from a young age and Mario received accolades including being a State Champion in judo. Mario went on to earn many other titles before he started training Gracie Jiu-Jitsu under the guidance of Marcelo Behring. Today, Mario Yamasaki is one of the best known and most respected MMA referees in the world. Fernando Yamasaki started his martial arts training in judo and wrestling before starting his training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Mario Yamasaki moved to the US and opened the first Brazilian/Gracie Jiu-Jitsu school in the DC area in 1995. Fernando joined Mario and business partner Francisco Neto in 2003. Currently the Yamasaki family has several schools and affiliated schools around the United Sates, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Europe.";"https://grappling.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/LOGO.png";"https://grappling.com/programs/";"The Kids' Jiu-Jitsu classes at Yamasaki Academy aim to create extra support for the parents by teaching children discipline, self-control, improved self-esteem and the ability to focus better on tasks.

This martial art style is considered to be one of the best self-defenses for kids and adults since it is applied in response to physical aggression, which will not lead to violence.

Maryland’s zero tolerance policy, which prohibits students from defending themselves in school, has put our children and us parents in a very difficult position. Not only are kids afraid of bullies, getting beaten up or harrassed, but they are also afraid of the consequences of standing up for themselves. They are stuck between bullies and the system. At Kogen Dojo, an affiliate of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Maryland, we teach our young students to first attempt to verbally de-escalate a violent situation, giving them specific and direct phrases for dealing with bullies. If verbal de-escalation is not successful, our kids are taught to then tell an adult about the bullying behavior. The self defense skills we teach them are the last resort when all non-violent have been tried and have been unsuccessful. The ability to not have to fight is true power and our main goal is to empower the children that we teach. Patience, Tolerance, and Discipline are definining characteristics of a good Martial Artist. We teach our children that a real Martial Artist is Respecful and Humble, never someone who looks for fights or picks on others. Sometimes, sadly, the fight picks you and you are left with no option besides Self Defense. What sets Kogen Dojo apart as a Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Maryland affiliate is that we teach these values to our kids as well as the skills necessary to defend themselves when absolutely necessary.

This is done through numerous mat drills and jiu jitsu ""games."" Kids of all ages love the games, and before you know it, you will be practicing them at home with them! INTERMEDIATE - class is for students ages 10-15 or those more advanced in Jiu Jitsu. The class also centers around confidence building, and the fundamental movements of Jiu Jitsu and self defense, but goes further. Kids will learn techniques essential to jiu jitsu and self defense. They will be able to work with a partner and practice the techniques they learn with various levels of resistance. Once kids reach a high enough proficiency they will participate in controlled drilling of the movements they have learned against a resisting teammate or coach.

There are other organizations, such as the Bujinkan of Budo-Taijutsu that teach the more classical interpretation of ninjutsu which will be of interest to those interested in the traditions and origins of this martial art. Ninjutsu is a broad and profound martial art. In the modern era, we don't deal with roving bandits, or well-armored samurai. Luckily, the martial lessons learned over the centuries of development behind Ninjutsu teach universal lessons that echo on.

In fact, many believe that fear of bullying may be the leading cause of low self confidence in children. Worse, statistics suggest that less then 15% of kids actually report acts of bullying. We know that most bullies are insecure and seek self esteem by harassing smaller or weaker children. Mash Gym has three objectives with our kids classes: 1. Boost confidence: Bullies are less likely to target self confident children. We instill confidence by teaching techniques that will neutralize the attack of a larger opponent. 2. Increase awareness: Harassment from bullies can be physical or verbal and delivered at various intensity levels. In each lesson, we focus on teaching your child to recognize and respond to the most common physical and verbal bully behaviors. 3. Be ready: Only when your child makes it clear that he/she will not tolerate the harassment, will they free themselves of the bullies torment. We will prepare them for every common contingency. Furthermore, we teach children how to diffuse confrontations with words and never to initiate physical aggression. If attacked, we offer techniques to non-violently neutralize the threat and gain control until help arrives. At Mash Gym we teach the children how to “fight fire with water.” Besides equipping your child with all these skills on the mats, and playground, we have also added the character development program. Aside from preparing your child to deal with bullies, the other objective of our program is to instill your child the character traits that will lead to success in all areas of life.

These skills will help them become better students at school, better listeners at home and help them to enter society with greater confidence. Little Ninjas learn to say “yes sir” and “yes ma’am”, they learn to look adults in the eyes when speaking and are taught the importance of good manners, focus and self-control all in a fun, positive learning environment. The patient black belt instructors utilize imaginative games like “jump the dragon tail” (where little ninjas dodge, evade and block a colored pool noodle) and the “ninja jungle walk” (students try and walk across a path of bubble wrap paper trying not to pop the bubbles) to keep the students captivated. These fun martial art drills help to build strong hand-eye coordination, balance, agility and timing. The ninjas stay super motivated by earning new belts, stickers and trophies. Students start out with a white belt and at the end of each 30 minute class when they do a good job in class they earn a recognition stripe on the tip of their belt. That is their short term goal. This reaffirms the lesson that their behavior and attitude has consequences. When they accumulate enough belt stripes they are awarded a new belt (their long term goal) and we do a special ceremony for them – which build tremendous confidence. These young martial artists, in addition, learn powerful personal development skills like “whining gets you nothings”, sleeping in their own bed all night, the rules of sharing and that they need only to be told something once by a parent. And, all Ninjas are equipped with the “Rule of Kicking and Punching” – and that they are not allowed to use their skills at school, on siblings, furniture or friends.";"https://seungnima.com/womens-self-defense-program/";"Our program’s goal is to empower women and give them the tools they need to defend themselves against an attacker.

"Warrior Way Martial Arts";"https://warriorway.com/";(248) 960-4884;"3100 Old Farm Lane";"Walled Lake";"MI";48390;;"United States";"On October 13th, 1997 Warrior Way Martial Arts Alliance opened its doors in Walled Lake, Michigan. Co-founded by three friends and training partners-Harvy Berman, Scott Lewis, and Bill Thompson - Warrior Way would soon grow to become the best Martial Arts academy in the state of Michigan. Warrior Way has a large kids program taught by instructors with backrounds in education. The practice of Martial Arts is a routine that improves focus and self discipline, developing the mind as well as the body. Students learn to control themselves to respect others, which naturally leads to a respect for self, improving self-esteem and self-confidence. This benefit often carries over into school, helping to not only improve behavior, but academic performance. Experts agree that, rather than promoting violence, Martial Arts open the door to building a solid foundation of self-confidence and a healthy sense of self worth. The core philosophy of Warrior Way’s Kids training is non-violence. When faced with a violent situation, our students are trained to respond in a calm and controlled way that will stop, rather than escalate, violence. Warrior Way has the distinction of having the longest running Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program in the state. Almost every school and instructor in Michigan can trace their training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu back to Warrior Way. Second-Degree Black Belt Professor Harvy Berman has worked tirelessly to help grow the sport in Michigan. With over 20 years of experience, Professor Harvy can trace his lineage back to the Gracie Family, who developed the art in Brazil almost 90 years ago. Warrior Way also has the only full-time staff of several Black Belts teaching all the classes at Warrior Way. In 2003, Warrior Way added the skills of World Champion Muay Thai Kickboxer Matee Jedeepitak to its already impressive staff of instructors. During his time as a professional fighter, Matee held two of the most prestigious titles in his homeland of Thailand, the Lumpinee and World Muay Thai Council championships. During his time in the United States, Matee also added the I.K.F. Pro San Shou Welterweight World Championship to his collection. With over 200 professional fights, there is no one in the midwest that has achieved what Matee has inside the rings of Thailand. As an instructor, Matee uses his lifelong experience to help students perfect the traditional style of Muay Thai Kickboxing at Warrior Way and across the country in his seminars. Our goal at Warrior Way is to help people better their lives through self confidence, discipline and physical fitness that training in the Martial Arts can bring. Based on reality, our systems provide you with a realistic form of self-defense that anyone, regardless of age or physical ability, can learn. Though Warrior Way has produced several BJJ World Champions, Muay Thai Champions, as well as amateur and professional MMA champions, Warrior Way’s number one priority us teaching the basics in a structured and safe enviornment. As a way of honoring those who protect us, Warrior Way also worlds closely with the local law enforcement to help keep those in uniform safe while on duty.";"https://warriorway.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ww_logo2.png";"https://warriorway.com/programs/warrior-way-kids-youth/";"Warrior Way Little Warriors Classes: These classes are open to any child ages 4, 5 and 6 years old.

We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus!

While serving in the US Navy, Bob Easom taught Karate, Judo and Ju-Jitsu (along with with noted AJJF/Hawaiian Ju-Jitsu instructor Bill Beach) at the former Twin Cities/Fort Snelling Naval Air Station, and decided to also offer training to the local civilian community. By 1968, we had a permenant location on Minnehaha Ave in South Minneapolis. In 1970, Bob Easom was relocated by the US Navy when the Twin Cities Naval Air Station was decommisioned, and World of Self-Defense was taken over by his top Black Belt, Ron Peterson (1943-2018), who had also trained at the Fort Snelling Naval Air Station's Judo & Ju-Jitsu club. World of Self-Defense was affiliated with the Armed Forces Judo Association, the American Judo and Jujitsu Federation (AJJF) and the Kodenkan Karate Association until the mid-1970's, when World of Self-Defense organized its Kosen Ju-Jitsu association which stressed realistic self-defense and ground grappling. During this time we moved to our current location at 5406 43rd Ave. World of Self-Defense/Combat Ju-Jitsu is now run by Ron Peterson's son Steve Peterson, who literally grew up with Ju-Jitsu, leading adult classes while still in his teens before eventually taking over the school from his father. Steve has been head instructor for more than 25 years. In the 1990's, ""Mixed Martial Arts"" events like the UFC increased public awareness of Ju-Jitsu's advantanges, and many students have found our club to be exactly what they were looking for.";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/Resources/gi1o.jpeg";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/child.html";"Our youth classes are popular with both boys & girls from 5 to 15. In addition to valuable self-defense skills, students will be able to develop: Self-discipline; Self-confidence; Respect for self and others; Focus/Attention; Good Sportsmanship; Good coordination & reflexes; Balance, strength, and agility; Leadership skills; Cooperation with others. All in a relaxed, fun, friendly environment!";"http://combat-jujitsu.com/cjj/wsd.html";"Ju-Jitsu for Women's Self-Defense: While ""Aerobic Kickboxing,"" ""Sport Karate"" and ""Classical"" or ""Traditional"" Martial Arts may be fun activities, they are often not effective against real-life aggressive attacks that ""go to the ground"", and unfortunately that's exactly where attacks on women often end up. If you are serious about learning effective self-defense, it is absolutely essential that you practice defending against a resisting opponent while you are on the ground as part of your training. That's what we're here for. Ju-Jitsu training will teach you to maximize your chances on the ground, where you can use leverage and positioning to defend against a larger attacker, instead of relying on upper-body strength. You will learn to use your whole body, and take advantage of your leg strength. We encourage women to attend our regular adult classes to gain valuable experience working with a wide variety of training partners. There is no substitute for regular training, and you will be amazed at what you will learn in just a few months. Across the country, more and more women are discovering the fun and effectivness of Ju-Jitsu training. Ju-Jitsu training can be hard work, and you will have a lot of close body contact with your training partner. Some people (and not just women!) are hesitant to learn Ju-Jitsu because the idea of rolling around with strange guys is just too uncomfortable. This close contact is a very important part of the learning process, and once you get to know your fellow students and instructors and learn how the techniques work, it quickly becomes a non-issue. The more experience you get in Ju-Jitsu class, the less likely you will panic in a real situation where someone is holding you down. You will always be in control of your training experience and we want you to be comfortable and enjoy your training with us.";;"Adult Class Rates: One Month $85, Four Months $290 ($72.50/month), One Year $800 (Less than $67/month!).

More confident children are more likely to avoid becoming victims, stand up to bullies, receive better grades in school, make more friends, and achieve goals that they set for themselves. In addition to confidence, our classes encourage children to adopt a healthier lifestyle. With the quick and exponential growth of technology, kids are spending more time becoming sedentary while staring at screens rather than being active and developing a healthy body and lifestyle.

Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is a self-defense system that enables the people who practice it to defend themselves by using leverage to submit opponents. This is done without throwing punches or kicks. Using our proven techniques your child will be able to defend themselves from bullies even though we do not teach them how to strike. Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is a fantastic way to promote an active and healthy lifestyle for kids of any ages. Parents of our students often find that their children gain self-esteem through athletic achievement and learn how to carry themselves better in situations that require them to deal with pressure. If your son or daughter is acting overly aggressive in school, lacks focus and or discipline then we at Gracie Columbia recommend you start them out with a private lesson to introduce them to the sport and class structure. They will learn that Commitment, Respect, Focus, Self-Discipline and effort always make a rewarding experience and bring positive results. Besides self defense skills that will give children a high degree of self confidence. Our Kids and Juniors programs will also work on: Developing listening, obedience and focusing skills; Improving social skills;  Improving self-control, respect and discipline; Increasing physical attributes such as hand-eye coordination, strength, agility and flexibility. What makes Gracie Jiu-Jitsu so effective for kids is the fact that instead of learning moves through katas or prearranged set of movements carried out on a cooperative training partner, they will learn how to apply grappling techniques on a resisting training partner who's not cooperating and is counteracting with his own moves, much like as what you'd see on the streets.";;;;;"http://graciesemo.com/index.html#Schedule";;"Brian Imholz";;"capebjj@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/GracieSemo/";"https://www.youtube.com/@graciejiujitsusoutheastmis5659/";"https://youtu.be/Exwj4hLSC48";"https://www.instagram.com/graciehumaitasemo/";;0;2600;;;"US";;

If you are a parent who trains, you will be encouraged to join class and share the experience. Our trusted teens are also encouraged to come in early to roll with the younger kids. This both makes them more comfortable switching classes when it’s time, and gives the best kids needed challenges. The teen class also has adults arrive early to train. Our kids class (12 & Under) is modeled after the adult class, except it’s one hour. They go through the same warmups and a similar lesson. The last 20 minutes of each class is live rolling for 3 minute rounds. Every single roll is watched by an adult who trains, and pairs are picked carefully. I don’t push kids to compete, but fully support the ones who are interested. Our goal in the kids class is to familiarize them with good Jiu Jitsu and encourage them to have fun actually training. We don’t play many games. Self defense, confidence, and discipline are naturally occurring byproducts of actually training. Our teenage class (16 & Under) is also modeled after the adult class. Again, they do the same warmups. If there’s a crazy cutting edge new version of the week’s lesson, the teenagers will be our crash test dummies. I would rather them learn how to do these things safely than watching a video twice and doing something silly. Also, they are more likely to respect a hard no in the name of safety. I will encourage your teenager to compete. Anyone who trains at that age either secretly or openly wants to be good. They will be encouraged to take every opportunity and problem solve and prioritize to get there. This is also the age where I encourage seminars and open mats.

We help the kids develop confidence, to become aware of what they can do and meet their potential in our MMA, Jiu-Jitsu, and Judo classes. This confidence will help to build strength, endurance, flexibility, balance, and coordination. There are other benefits as well-not just physical. Along with being a well-known training facility for teens and adults, Finney’s MMA prides itself on our Mini-Finney program available to boys and girls, ages 4-13 years, regardless of prior experience. Our Mini-Finney program develops physical fitness while instilling a sense of self-worth as the kids learn new skills in a fun and safe environment. A child faces new challenges every day: time-management, homework, good-manners, and even bullies. Our Mini-Finney’s program is an excellent way for children to learn valuable tools to help handle life’s many challenges–all while having a great time! We focus on building attitude, discipline, and respect in our students so they have an advantage not only when it comes to martial arts but everyday life. Mini-Finney’s is 5 days a week, 45 minutes per class, and is designed to teach children self-defense, self-confidence, responsibility, and the value of hard work in a safe atmosphere which is organized and run by professionals. Martial arts can positively impact kids by improving their life-skills and placing emphasis on their values and attitudes. They learn to focus, which can eventually improve study habits, listening skills, and ability to follow direction, which can all lead to better performance in school. Focused kids have an easier time setting and achieving goals, which can then carry on throughout their lives. Our classes are a positive way for children to release stress, learn the importance of physical fitness, and feel accomplishment after earning achievement. We have several strategies to teach the value of setting goals, working toward them, and fulfilling them: Our students can witness the results of hard work first hand as they improve at the techniques they’ve learned through attentive listening and practice. Our Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program offers belt advancement based on technique and character. Our students often compete in grappling competitions and kickboxing exhibitions, where they learn the thrill of competition as their team and coaches cheer them on. A skilled martial artist is a result of years of dedication, practice, effective learning, and a positive, respectful attitude. Our students learn these lessons while having a great time working toward a goal.";;;"MMA, Kickboxing, Boxing, Wrestling, Judo";;"http://finneyskickboxing.com/class-schedule/";"Mon-Fri: 5:30am-9:00pm, Sat: 7:00am-1:00pm; Sun: 8:00am-1:00pm";"Jesse Finney";"1 FREE trial class";"tim@finneyskickboxing.com";"https://www.facebook.com/finneys.mma";"https://www.youtube.com/@finneysmma41/";"https://youtu.be/ZInG9PxjG0s";"https://www.instagram.com/finneys_mma/";;0;2617;;;"US";;

The Kids BJJ program at SFC Mixed Martial Arts teaches the full range of grappling skills and techniques that the adult classes teach, but at a pace and time frame more appropriate for younger members. Classes are one hour in duration, and typically include callisthenic warmups; takedown and grappling drilling; and sparring, or “rolling.” Occasionally, the class will play fun grappling-skill games in lieu of sparring. Kids Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art based on grappling and ground fighting techniques. Children will learn how to control and subdue a larger and stronger opponent through the use of superior techniques, leverage, and body mechanics. With an emphasis on grappling rather than striking, children are able to practice with varying levels of intensity, without the threat of serious injuries which can occur more often in martial arts focused on punching and kicking. Children will gain strength, endurance, dexterity, control, balance, discipline, situational awareness and self-respect through the training, and they will have fun and make friends while learning the most effective form of self-defense.

All the Gracie were slight of frame, but Helio was particularly small and frail. Because of his small stature, Helio could not use many of the Japanese moves that were based on power and speed, so he developed new leverages and new ways of doing moves. Helio turned out to be a brilliant innovator, and the style he developed proved to be victorious against all others, regardless of size. For the next seventy-five years the Gracie family dedicated themselves to the preservation and dissemination of this great fighting style - Gracie Jiu Jitsu. Our owner and head instructor Professor JW Wright has been training with Helio's son, Master Royler Gracie and Master David Adiv since 1999. He earned his black belt in 2008 and has been teaching the art of Gracie Jiujitsu in this area since 2002.

In the Gracie Bullyproof® program, our goal is to instill in your child unshakable confidence so they can overcome bullies without violence. Due to the non-violent nature of the techniques, CNN, ABC, NBC, and Oprah have featured the Gracie Bullyproof program as one of the few effective counter-measures to bullying for children between the ages of 5 and 13. We will teach your child to use verbal assertiveness to deter bullies and several non-violent self-defense techniques to stay safe if physically assaulted. Importantly, we don’t teach how to punch or kick, since this often does more harm than good. Instead, we use leverage-based control holds to neutralize threats without violence. Numerous school districts have embraced the defensive nature of the Gracie Bullyproof techniques as a reasonable, nonviolent response to bullying and some even host Gracie Bullyproof classes on campus! The bottom line is: we will prepare your child to defend themselves against bullies without turning them into one. If you’re interested in instilling your child with unshakable confidence while reinforcing positive values and good character, the Gracie Bullyproof program is for you!

Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents.

As the culture modernized, jiu jitsu evolved into a self defense practice which relies more on takedowns, throws and ground fighting. In the early 20th century, Mitsuo Maeda, a Japanese immigrant into Brazil, introduced the Gracie family to the art. The Gracies updated and streamlined the combative techniques and tested it in countless bouts and challenge matches. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is now one of the most popular systems of self defense and combat sport in the world. Academy owner and lead instructor David Cronenwett has been an active student and practitioner of jiu jitsu since 1996, and received his black belt, after many years of moving around Montana, in October 2015. Helena BJJ is an affiliate of Lovato Jiu Jitsu Association, led by American grappling legend, Rafael Lovato.

What we provide at Triad Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a safe, clean, and ego friendly environment to help all that take part improve their self confidence, self discipline and self defense. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or BJJ for short, promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger, heavier assailant by using proper technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint-locks and chock holds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments. However, it can be used in some self-defense situations as well. Here at Triad Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, we have countless stories from both parents of children to adults themselves of how BJJ has positively impacted their lives. Our success stories include exceptional weight losses, self-confidence boosting, learning how to handle bullies, and friendships that last for life.

The roots of BJJ Revolution date back to the 1970s in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, the location of the acclaimed Carlson Gracie Academy. Considered by many as the most successful Jiu-Jitsu academy in the history of the sport, the Carlson Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Team was the true juggernaut of competitive BJJ and MMA for nearly 3 decades. This school was the flagship for innovation in Jiu-Jitsu and lead by one of the most important and influential figures in history, Master Carlson Gracie. Training and discovering the teachings, firsthand, from Master Carlson Gracie, creators of BJJ REVOLUTION TEAM, Master Julio Cesar “Foca” Fernandez Nunes and Master Rodrigo Medeiros, became devoted to continuing the traditions that began in their homeland so many years ago. Arriving in America, it was their vision to start a martial arts revolution by spreading the knowledge, techniques, and integrity of Master Carlson Gracie. After 6-National Titles, 10-US Grappling Titles and thousands of families now practicing, history has proven that their methods were, and continue to be, on target.";"https://thedojoarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dojoarts.png";"https://thedojoarts.com/classes/";"Our Kids Jiu Jitsu classes are conducted similarly to our adult classes with adjustments to make it more age appropriate and engaging for children.

Furthermore, that very fear of bullying leads to low self-esteem and depression in children and adolescents alike. Making matters worse is the fact that bullying goes virtually unaccounted for, with less than 15% of children actually reporting the abuse. Bullies rely on fear tactics, coercion and intimidation to gain power. They assert dominance over their victims through repeated acts of aggressive behavior, inflicting both physical and mental harm. Though it is common knowledge that the only way to defeat bullies is to stand up to them, most children feel incapable of confronting their tormentors because of an overwhelming concern for their personal safety.

Since 2016, Fènix JJ has worked hard to build an atmosphere that makes learning “the gentle art” as comfortable and laid back as it can be, while still upholding the high standards and principles that its founders set many years ago. There are several classes available at Fènix. We offer morning, youth, fundamental, advanced, and striking classes, as well as “no gi” or submission wrestling. This is very similar to regular Jiu Jitsu but without the traditional uniform. Fènix offers the largest mat space in the area, as well as heavy bags for striking, changing rooms, and fantastic instruction. We provide our students with a clean environment to train in and the dedication to improve the lives of every student. This is what makes Fènix stand out.

GRAPPLERS (8-12 YEARS OLD) - In the Jr. Grapplers program, we focus on 33 non-violent self-defense techniques that teach children to “neutralize and negotiate” with the bullies. Verbal assertiveness strategies are a major portion of this curriculum. A child needs absolutely no experience to start, and we guarantee a noticeable increase in your child’s confidence within a few weeks!";"https://sites.google.com/view/minotgjj/women-empowered";"Women Empowered is the official Gracie self-defense program for women based on the techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). In this 15-lesson program, we will teach you how to neutralize the 20 most common attacks ranging from having your hair grabbed to being pinned to the ground by a weapon-bearing assailant. Each one-hour Women Empowered lesson addresses two techniques. You can start the program at any time and participate in any class without previous experience. Unlike most self-defense systems that rely heavily on strength, speed, and coordination, the techniques in the Women Empowered program employ leverage, technique, and timing, so anyone, regardless of age or athletic ability, can make them work against larger opponents. Once you complete the Women Empowered program, you may test for promotion to pink belt! Please note you will need to pay the full evaluation fee each time you take a test, and when you pass the test, you will receive your official Women Empowered Pink Belt and promotion certificate at no additional cost. Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the perfect self-defense system for women, but only if it is taught correctly. If you’re unsure about learning BJJ for fear of injury, embarrassment, or any other reason, then the Women Empowered program is perfect for you! If you’ve tried BJJ at another school and had a negative experience, give Women Empowered a chance, and we guarantee it will win you back to the mat!";;;"https://sites.google.com/view/minotgjj/about-us/schedule";;"Jesse Ward";"10-Day Free Trial";"gracieminot@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/gracieminot";;;"https://www.instagram.com/gracieminot/";;0;2746;;;"US";;

His family has had a long tradition of fighters including his great grandfather Mickey Finn, the legendary bare knuckle champion of Ireland. Mick began Martial Arts training at the age of 7. From 1980 to 1985 Mick went undefeated and become the Irish Kickboxing Champion. For three of those years Mick was forced to fight in the adult divisions, even though he had not met his majority. His tournament and fight schedule allowed him to travel much of Northern Europe. On December 6th, 1986 at the age of 18 Mick made the decision to immigrate to the United States. He attended Bellevue University full time until 1988 when a position opened up at Saint Joseph Center for Mental Health where he became the Fitness coordinator for the hospital, it’s patients and staff. He also opened his first Martial Arts school in the same year called The Midwest fighting Arts Academy. In 1989 he met one of his childhood goals—being recognized as one the best active fighters in the world. He was ranked the number one welterweight fighter in the IKKC World rankings by Denver based World promoter Vern Stephenson, and later that year one his first World Title in Muay Thai. In September 1994, Mick won his second World title. The IKBO (International Kickboxing Organization ) based out of Emmen, Holland and run by Mr. Fred Royers. On April 25th, 1996 Mick was appointed Head Coach of the United States Muay Thai Team. In May of that year Mick traveled with the team to Thailand to train and compete in the Princes Cup World Championship. After returning from Thailand, Mick began to spend more time perfecting his Jui Jitsu and Grappling skills. Mick was introduced to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu by his friends Scott Thompson and R.J Nebe who were the first blue belts in the midwest under the legendary Rickson Gracie. Renzo Gracie came to Omaha to train with Mick at the gym as did John Lewis and Igor Zinoviev. In 1998 Mick wanted to test his new found skills of grappling and No Holds Barred fighting with a real competition and won the Budokai Bare Knuckle Challenge in Springfield Missouri. Also in 1998, Mick won the Grand Championship Belt at Bas Rutten’s U.S. Open Jui Jitsu/ Tough Man Tournament in Denver, Colorado. His last full contact fight was in Beijing China in 1999 as part of the first professional mixed martial arts fight ever done in China. Since retiring from competition Mick has devoted his energies to continuing his advancement as a Martial Artist and a coach. He currently holds the rank of Brown Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under Master Fabio Santos who is one of the highest ranking students of Rickson Gracie. He strives to teach people the life’s lessons he has learned from years of constantly challenging and pushing himself to be the best. The odds have always been stacked against him. From being blind in one eye, to immigrating to the U.S. at the age of 18, unsure of what his future in this country would hold. Mick has faced all these challenges with the courage and determination of a modern day warrior. . He is currently the head coach of the National amateur Mixed Martial Arts team and has trained more National champions than any other coach in the United States. To date, he has coached 37 National Champions and cornered 6 World Champions. His seminars and fighter coaching sessions and methods are among the best in the world. He has lived his life by the Samurai maxim “everything, everybody, outside of myself is my teacher”.";;"http://www.mickdoyle.com/programs/";"Our youth program is based on the teachings and drills of Gan Teora. The kids are taught that learning Martial arts is a big responsibility as they are learning skills that could save their lives, and that it is not something which you show off or bully others with. Through the disciplined training, the child will develop self-defense, self-discipline, and self-respect. The children progress through a belt system but unlike some Martial Arts schools we do not believe that a child or parent should be bound to a long term contract that promises a black belt at the end of a year or two. Our Black Belts are the finest examples of men and women that you will find. They are well-rounded martial artists who have recognized the importance of a healthy lifestyle and will demonstrate leadership and maturity in everything that they do.

One is able to force an adversary to quit attacking through the use of various joint manipulations, joint locks, and also a variety of chokes.  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has grown in popularity over the years as it is also practiced as a sport where two people display their skills in an attempt to gain superior positions for points all the way to ending the match thru a variety of submission holds. The use of Jiu-Jitsu can also be displayed in today’s sport of Mixed Martial Arts.  Traditionally, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is taught with students wearing a GI or Kimono.  This is what the uniform is called that students wear.  The art is also taught where students wear just shorts and t-shirt to give a different look to what may apply in an everyday setting.  This is called NO GI as a student is not wearing the GI to train in. There is a belt ranking system in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu which is as follows:  White, Blue, Purple, Brown, and Black.  Each belt has 4 degrees or stripes within it that one achieves on their way to the next belt level.  Students should expect to be very patient when it comes to promotion in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as many practitioners take 10 to 12 years to obtain a black belt.

Whether the student finds an interest in being the next BJJ world champion, or uses BJJ to simply become more confident in themselves, we will be happy to develop all these skills with each student in the best way we can.";;;;;"http://aqueousbjj.com/schedule";;"Greg West";;"GregWest@AqueousBJJ.com";"https://www.facebook.com/AqueousBJJ";"https://www.youtube.com/@aqueousbjj4967/";"https://youtu.be/vpatAQfRulE";"https://www.instagram.com/aqueousbjj/";;0;2757;;;"US";;

Increasingly popular as a martial art because it perfectly complements the stand-up strikes and kicks taught in other disciplines. Jiu Jitsu employs effective, non-violent self-defense techniques. The intention behind Jiu Jitsu is to subdue an opponent with the least amount of effort and harm. This art initially came about as a way for smaller individuals to protect themselves on the ground from a larger opponent during a street fight. Using simple leverage as a weapon, practitioners can neutralize a situation without even throwing a punch. It is often called the “gentle art.” ROLLSTAR Jiu Jitsu upholds the principles and values of respect, integrity, perseverance, honor, discipline, excellence, positivity, efficiency, and technique.

At our Lyndhurst Martial Arts Academy, our adult students usually fall into 3 general categories or a combination of the following: There is the person or ex HS athlete who is looking to learn how to fight more effectively and wants to to compete. There is the person who wants to learn how to defend themselves and their family confidently in a dangerous situation. Then there’s the person who is looking for a workout that pushes them beyond the typical gym fitness class. Regardless of your motivation and reasons for wanting to train, our experienced and professional staff will help you find the right fit. At Savarese BJJ, Northern New Jersey’s top Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy, we have some of the best BJJ instructors in NJ. All have been trained in every aspect of BJJ. ALL of our instructors trained with us and by us. Every single one was a student here first. Just like progressive academic schools do not teach all students with just one learning method, neither should a martial arts school assume that one style fits all. Maybe you’re someone who is athletic and is looking for a new challenge, and needs classes that demand higher intensity and challenge. Maybe you’re someone who is just looking to get ‘off the couch’ and you’ve tried joining this or that fitness class or gym and it’s just not working for you. What you’ll find at Savarese BJJ is that the style of martial art is secondary to your goals as a person. Are you looking to learn self-defense in a fun and friendly environment? Do you want to get in shape and be active? Do you want to give yourself the confidence to handle physical situations? Is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for you? Should you try the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Self Defense classes? Or you over 40 and don’t want to train live? We have executive and Self Defense classes for you. These are questions you will answer for yourself once you get some time to meet with our staff and try out some classes. Once you train with our professional instructors as well as mixing with other Lyndhurst BJJ students, you’ll know within a very short amount of time what the right fit for you is. and our instructors are here to answer questions and help – just like they’ve done for hundreds of other students.";"https://njbjj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sav-Login-Logo-300x113.png";"https://njbjj.com/brazilian-jiu-jitsu-classes-lyndhurst-nj/lyndhurst-nj-childrens-martial-arts/";"The main goal at Savarese Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy is to boost the self-esteem of our students, especially in our kids martial arts program. Statistics show that one out of four children are bullied in school or online. Many believe that fear of bullying may be the leading cause of low self-confidence in children. Worse, statistics suggest that only 36% of bullying is reported. At Savarese BJJ, we focus on the physical, emotional and mental well-being of our students. We call them”Life Skills.” We provide our young students with the most powerful defensive skills so they will be ready to stand up against bullies. Additionally, we assist our students with the development of characteristics and skills they will need in order to live a happy and balanced life. Our students develop confidence, discipline, courage, responsibility, and leadership among other important values. We promote non-violent resolutions to conflict. For many children learning to respect authority can be a difficult lesson to learn. Respecting authority is quite important in the teaching of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. We aim to develop life-improvement skills as well as building the child’s character in a positive way. Our belief is uncoachable kids become unemployable adults. We teach these skills in the most fun atmosphere possible. Lyndhurst NJ Children’s Martial Arts is beneficial in many ways.

Our women’s program was specifically designed to prepare women for real life threatening situations. In addition, our self defense techniques provide the knowledge and skills for any woman to escape from her attacker, whether she is on her feet or on the ground. This course is unique because it does not rely exclusively on punching and kicking like other forms of martial arts. Punching and kicking do not represent an effective strategy against an assailant who is bigger, stronger and capable of hitting back. In addition, they are useless on the ground, which is where an attacker is most likely to assault a woman. It is structured to achieve maximum comfort for females interested in pursuing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. This class offers a relaxed, non-threatening environment ideal for the beginner or intermediate student to grow and learn quickly under the guidance of experienced and highly-accomplished female instructors. Your 1st intro lesson will be with a female instructor. After that, you are in co-ed classes. We understand that some women feel intimidated stepping inside a martial arts school with more experienced students or with the majority of male students. We used to do all women’s classes.

This victorious ascent started with Sensei Ricardo Carvalho’s initiative when he decided to start his own academy because of the large number of students he had. Previously, in 1989, his brother - Sensei Edson Carvalho - had left to fight in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he quickly attained and established great fame. So with intentions to honor his brother Sensei Ricardo Carvalho named the academy after him. At that time, Jiu-Jitsu was being promoted in the state of Bahia in Brazil, although the largest concentration of fighters was in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and the city of Manaus in the state of Amazonas. Sensei Edson Carvalho is a native of Bahia and because he already had a large following and respected name in Rio de Janeiro, he was able to command a greater interest and his fellow citizens' great admiration thus he was the catalyst for the growth of Jiu-Jitsu in Bahia. Competitions were taking place everywhere in Bahia and they were great incentives for fighters who wanted better performances and greater competitiveness; all with a healthy and positive balance. In that context, Senseis Edson and Ricardo Carvalho created “(JJFB) Federacao Baina De Jiu-Jitsu” in 1996.  Their objective was to manage the growth of the sport in Bahia different from other states. After all, they had an extensive historical and strong influence from the discipline of Judo in their backgrounds. The difference is in the slogan of JJFB: "" Jiu-Jitsu Against Drugs"". A philosophy of discipline and respect among the participants, athletes and leaders is followed not only by JJFB but for all that join Team Carvalho anywhere in the world. Welcome to Team Carvalho! You are family!!! Come in and make yourself at home.";;"http://www.teamcarvalho.com/kids-judo.html";"Judo is a great activity for kids. It was designed to be that way on purpose.

Old Program - Children between the ages of 4 - 6 years old are in a very distinct growing stage. They are embarking on new discoveries everyday and learning how to cope with all of the challenges. Their intellect, emotions, physical capabilities, and social competence all are growing at a rapid rate. So fast, that they often overlook what’s important and can hardly tell the difference between right and wrong. That’s where the MATKidz Prep Course Program comes into play. Our program was specially designed for the stages of development of 3-6 year olds. Our experience regarding this age group will ensure that our program meets each child’s characteristics and capabilities. The MATKidz Program is a preliminary martial arts training course that focuses on building capabilities; physically, emotionally, socially, and intellectually. This program will help shape each student’s life in a way that will positively enhance their future. Emphasis in this program is on building confidence by teaching each child to properly use their upper and lower body in defensive postures, positions, and situations both standing and on the ground. Rolling, climbing, evading, and fitness are an important part of this program. The class is fun, high energy and utilizes different pads, mats, and teaching aids to enhance the training experience. Juniors 7-13 Yr. Old Program - This course was designed specially for children ages 7 to 13 years old. We realize that children this age have specific characteristics that differ from children younger than them. They are sharper and more focused however they are still not quite ready to face the same challenges presented to young adults. With the dream and haunts of being a teenager, which is right around the corner, there are many physical, emotional, social, and intellectual challenges that they all face. With the right developments and positive reinforcement, your child will face their transition as a teenager with an enthusiastic outlook. Imagine your son or daughter at the top of their class intellectually. We’re not talking about a straight “A” student, although that does help, we’re talking about a child who is smart enough to make the right decisions; a child who knows how to set and achieve goals; a child who understands the importance of commitment; a child who knows how to persevere through the most difficult challenges; a child who knows when to say “no”. Also imagine your child in the middle of a positive social circle who knows how to make and keep friends. Vision your child physically competent, capable of meeting and completing physical challenges. Best image yet, think about how relieving it would feel to see your child day in and day out cope with emotional challenges with a positive outlook.";;;"Self Defense, Muay Thai, MMA";;"https://www.theedgemma.com/schedule";;"Justin Rios";;"edgemmainfo@gmail.com";"https://www.facebook.com/theedgeuma";"https://www.youtube.com/@richsab66";"https://youtu.be/NVlryA0hnQM";"https://www.instagram.com/edgeuma/";;0;2820;;;"US";;

Like many Jiu Jitsu gyms we care deeply about Jiu Jitsu itself. Where we stand apart, however, is teaching. Teaching Jiu Jitsu to our students is our passion. While most gyms focus on “grinding” or “going hard” we work obsessively to teach Jiu Jitsu to our students in the most technical, most effective, and most comprehensive ways possible. We want our students to not only learn the small details of techniques that make the difference between success and failure at the highest levels, but also for them to understand the overall game of grappling better than their competitors. This means that they will be better equipped to both execute a given technique, and to choose the right technique for a given situation. When we look at what matters most for any student to receive from a teacher it is skill sets, knowledge, and proficiency. This is what we provide to every single student at our gym. At Impact we work tirelessly to ensure our students will become true experts in Jiu Jitsu, and we do this in an environment of camaraderie, integrity, and respect.";"https://impactjjabq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cropped-trianglepng.png";;"Jiu Jitsu Minis | Ages 3-4 - Our youngest students’ program targets awareness and increased coordination, improvement in children’s vestibular system and comfort with multiplanar and directional movement, following 1-2 step directions that includes use of their body, working with other people’s bodies in a safe way, focused attention, and HAVING FUN with others. We also target the primary movements and skills/terminology of Jiu Jitsu to prepare for our Little Roller’s program at age 5. Little Rollers | Ages 5-8 - Our younger students receive technical Jiu Jitsu training, covering fundamentals from take downs, positions, and transitions, to age appropriate submissions and competition skills.

There are only training partners - “Uke” - engaged in a cooperative learning experience aimed to make each other better not only as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners but as human beings. To excel in any endeavor, discipline is essential. It is no different in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. At Santa Fe BJJ the discipline of training and the willingness to sacrifice for higher achievements is reinforced in and outside the school. Inside Santa Fe BJJ, all people must act with warmth and equality toward one another, regardless of differences in race, creed, nationality, etc. Respect for the hierarchy of the ranks is also very strong and the authority of a Black Belt is truly recognized. Santa Fe BJJ Instructors shall understand their importance on students lives as role models, as well as their responsibility in bringing out the best each person has within. Our Instructors shall reinforce that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a life long journey with no ending point. Students must perceive the Black Belt as their minimum goal and that their progress represents an increasing commitment to their growth as BJJ practitioners and human beings. Santa Fe BJJ Instructors shall lead by example, kindness, and care. The formal authority shall always and ever be supported by their moral authority built upon a positive, cooperative, and constructive attitude towards the students and other instructors. Santa Fe BJJ Instructors shall teach a class as a privilege and never take it as a burden. Each class is the realization of a dream, the instructor life’s work. They must enjoy every minute of it and teach like it was going to be their last opportunity to change students lives for better.";"https://i0.wp.com/www.santafebjj.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cropped-jiu-jitsu-for-everyone-plus-sf-gb-BEST-JPEG-1.jpg?w=1000";;;;;"Aikido, Kickboxing, Cardio Kickboxing, MMA";;"http://www.santafebjj.com/full-schedule-2/";;"Thomas Pless";;;"https://www.facebook.com/graciebarrasantafe/";;;"https://www.instagram.com/graciebarra_santafenm/";;0;2859;;;"US";;

Long before the current MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) trend of combining martial arts styles started in the US, Dr. Dennis Hanover was fusing, Karate, Judo and Ju-Jitsu (sometimes spelled Jiu-Jitsu) together to create a unique self-defense/fighting style that could be taught to both civilians and Israeli military personnel – the system is now taught to elite units in the Israeli army, as well as the Mossad. This unique and effective system is now offered in Henderson, Las Vegas by Tomer Steinberg, 7th Degree Black Belt, and 2011 World Champion – the highest ranked instructor of the system in the U.S. We offer a warm welcome to all who come and train with us and practice our message of respect both on and off the mats.

It helps develop self-confidence, learn discipline and familiarize children with the value of hard work. One of Sergio’s main philosophies is that hard work beats talent when talent does not work as hard. He and his other instructors believe that when you work hard and try your best at something you can do anything. Studies show that children who participate in martial arts perform better in school, are physically healthier, have improved decision-making, and are less likely to be influenced by peer pressure. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu teaches respect for others and respect of self. With bullying an issue in children’s lives, it is necessary to give them the tools to prevent bullying all together. The first line of defense against bullying is confidence. BJJ classes help children gain self-esteem and confidence and teaches them how to defend themselves against such intrusions.";;;;;"https://sergiopenha.com/schedule/";"Mon, Wed, Fri: 10:00am-11:30am, 4:30pm-7:00pm; Tues, Thurs: 10:00am-11:30am, 5:30pm-7:00pm; Sat: 12:00pm-2:00pm";"Sergio Penha";;"info@sergiopenha.com";"https://www.facebook.com/sergiopenhabjj/";"https://www.youtube.com/@sergiopenhaofficial2769/";"https://youtu.be/n4GY9ZQXgtU";"https://www.instagram.com/sergiopenha_bjj/";;0;934;;;"US";;
